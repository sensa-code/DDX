If this is not possible, a gastric feeding tube must be placed to allow maintenance of hydration and nutrition (see p.\n1267).\nDilation can be accomplished by balloon or by esophageal bougienage. Balloon dilation is the preferred means of dilation and\nentails passage of an inflatable balloon catheter into the stricture site, inflating the balloon to allow the pressure to tear/break\ndown the scar tissue and thus increase the diameter of the esophageal lumen.\nAlternatively, bougienage involves the passage of rigid dilators of gradually increasing size through the stricture site. Both of\nthese procedures are facilitated by concurrent use of endoscopic (or fluoroscopic) guidance to monitor the procedural\nsuccess and identify complications (e.g., esophageal tear) early.\nCorticosteroids (e.g., prednisone, 0.5–1 mg/kg PO q 24 h × 5–10 days) may be considered in an attempt to delay fibrosis of\nrecently dilated strictures.","category":"textbook","species":[]},{"id":"04f02802-03bb-d291-a6fc-ea70f3b4400c","title":"Clinical Veterinary Advisor_ Do - Etienne Cote - 片段 1921","content":"tes, and dietary sources of vasoactive amines (e.g., certain types of\nfish).
