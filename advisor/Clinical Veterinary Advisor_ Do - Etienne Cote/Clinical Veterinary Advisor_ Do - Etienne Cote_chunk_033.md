information regarding possible hereditary factors


**RISK FACTORS**


elements that might predispose a patient to this disease or disorder


**CONTAGION & ZOONOSIS:**


important information regarding infectious spread of certain diseases


http://www.clinicalvetadvisor2.com/html/bc/ch002s001_s001_s000.php 20-09-2011


Introduction to Diseases and Disorders Página 2 de 3


**GEOGRAPHY AND SEASONALITY:**


features that would help to raise or lower the clinician’s index of suspicion for a disease or disorder, based on environment and timing of occurrence


**ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS & DISORDERS:**


entities that occur simultaneously or as a result of this disease/ disorder


**CLINICAL PRESENTATION**


**DISEASE FORMS/SUBTYPES:**


if applicable, the different variants of a disease a clinician should consider


**HISTORY, CHIEF COMPLAINT**


the information provided by the owner or caretaker (history), together with the primary reason for seeking veterinary attention (chief complaint)


**PHYSICAL EXAM FINDINGS**


the relevant abnormalities—or, if important, relevant normal findings—associated with the disease/disorder


**ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY**


The mechanisms and pathways according to which the disease or disorder begins and then evolves


**DIAGNOSIS**


**DIAGNOSTIC OVERVIEW**


New to this edition, this segment is a brief summary that states what is appropriate to achieve a functional clinical diagnosis in most cases of the disorder. The
goal of the Diagnostic Overview is to give direction to the reader/practitioner for applying the information provided subsequently. The result is diagnostic
guidance, rather than just a list of possible diagnostic tests.


**DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**


Other diseases or disorders that may mimic the one under discussion, and about which the reader should be aware


**INITIAL DATABASE**


A summary of basic clinical tests that are appropriate when this disease/disorder may be present. These are largely tests that should be accessible in most
outpatient clinics or facilities.


**ADVANCED OR CONFIRMATORY TESTING**


Diagnostic tests that are performed if the initial database is insuffi cient for establishing the diagnosis. Some of these tests may be performed easily in any clinic
or hospital, whereas others may require referral to a specialty center.


**TREATMENT**


**TREATMENT OVERVIEW**


Like the Diagnostic Overview, a new section that summarizes the goals and priorities of treatment. The purpose is to offer guidance in the application of
treatment information.


**ACUTE GENERAL TREATMENT**


Those forms of treatment that are instituted promptly, either because treatment is simple or because of immediate need


**CHRONIC TREATMENT**


When necessary, ongoing treatment typically provided at home


**NUTRITION/DIET**


Previously grouped within the preceding two segments, this area covers alterations of food intake or food type that may assist in treatment.


**BEHAVIOR/EXERCISE**


http://www.clinicalvetadvisor2.com/html/bc/ch002s001_s001_s000.php 20-09-2011


Introduction to Diseases and Disorders Página 3 de 3


Information pertaining to deliberate changes in physical activity (increase, decrease, or new) and any forms of treatment related to behavioral modifications.


**DRUG INTERACTIONS**


Relevant information regarding incompatibility of two or more medications commonly used in the treatment of the disease/disorder. This section by necessity is
perhaps one of the least comprehensive; the reader is advised to seek information from clinical pharmacology sources to assist in identifying potential or real
problems..


**POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS**


Selected, recognized problems that may occur as a result of the disease process alone or as a complication of treatment to be sought and addressed if it occurs


**RECOMMENDED MONITORING**


Methods the reader/practitioner should use for ensuring that treatment and/or resolution of the disease or disorder is proceeding as expected


**PROGNOSIS AND OUTCOME**


The expected evolution of the disease or disorder, with or without treatment. Important elements include survival time, survival rate, and expected variations in
clinical progression.


**PEARLS & CONSIDERATIONS**


**PEARLS**


Single items of counterintuitive observations, pitfalls to avoid, and other important points


**PREVENTION**


Methods to avoid recurrence or reduce occurrence of new cases


**TECHNICIAN TIPS**


New to this edition, this segment provides information relevant to nursing care and the role of the veterinary technician in managing cases of this disease
disorder.


**SUGGESTED READING**


Every disease and disorder has at least one outside source for additional consultation. In most cases, there are others as well. In addition to the Suggested

Artificial Insemination http://www.clinicalvetadvisor2.com/html/bc/ch003s001_s001_s008.php...


Fertile dogs experience normal pregnancy rates and litter sizes following intravaginal inseminations; however, intracervical or surgical
uterine inseminations may be advised for breeding bitches with frozen-thawed semen or low sperm doses.

BRAINSTEM AUDITORY EVOKED RESPONSE (BAER) TEST Bilateral deafness.


(Courtesy Dr. Peter Foley.)


POSTPROCEDURE


If the animal has been sedated, allow it to recover sufficiently before discharge.


ALTERNATIVES AND THEIR RELATIVE MERITS


There are no practical and accurate alternatives to establishing unilateral or bilateral deafness in dogs and cats. Bilateral deafness
can usually be suspected but not confirmed by subjective assessment of the animal's response to loud noises.

Behavioral Assessment http://www.clinicalvetadvisor2.com/html/bc/ch003s001_s002_s003.php...


Behavior history forms for cats can be shorter than those for dogs because cats rarely are trained and do not require the attention
that dogs do. Because cats are much less likely to demonstrate their misbehavior during an interview, a video recording of the cat
when it is aggressive is very helpful. If the problem is soiling an area in the house, time-lapse video recording can elucidate which cat
in a multicat household is soiling and what its preelimination and postelimination behaviors are. Many cats visit the litter box but
eliminate elsewhere, indicating an aversion to the litter or the box.


POSTPROCEDURE


Recheck the animal at 3 and 6 weeks to determine the success of the treatment and compliance of the owner.


ALTERNATIVES AND THEIR RELATIVE MERITS


Behavioral problems can be referred to trainers, but there is no quality assurance. Herbal remedies also lack quality control or
controlled studies of their efficacy.
