As I noted in the first edition, it would be a pleasure to say that this edition of the _Advisor_ will answer every
question that comes up in small animal practice. We all know that an honest assessment of any book says
otherwise. With the changes we have made, my hope is that past readers will be pleased to find that their early
interest in the _Advisor_ remains well founded, and that new readers will discover a source of information that
speaks to their interests.


**Acknowledgments**


It has been the selection of information and the careful consideration of what to include that has required the most energy when creating this second edition. To
you, the _Advisor's_ incredibly dedicated section editors and authors, I offer my heartfelt thanks. From this vantage point I can see perhaps better than anyone the
time you took and the effort you expended to create this book. You painstakingly identified relevant new information from the literature and then carefully crafted
the material, both old and new, into these compact synopses. For an enthusiastic and learned author, it can be much harder to write less than to write more. All
of us know that with writing comes sacrifice: we are busy with many obligations, and much of the work of good writing and editing simply comes when time is
available, at night, on weekends, or instead of doing something else. We are willing to do it when there is a positive result: something that shows we made a
difference for the better. Ultimately, this collective effort has produced a result of which we deserve to be proud, as I hope you will be. I expect your efforts will be
noticed by a great many readers, as they were for the first edition. Many, many readers have commented so favorably on it and this positive feedback is as good
a validation as any for showing the effect of your work. Students and veterinarians have told me repeatedly that the _Advisor_ is their first “go-to” resource when
they want to learn about something they are unfamiliar with; in many hospitals, the book is used so heavily that it has been reduced to tatters (see below) and
has had to be re-bound; several board-certified specialists have told me they use the book routinely for information within and outside their specialty; and I have
received many, many emails and letters praising your work, simply summarized as: “I think this book is terrific.” These testimonials, as much as anything I can
say, indicate the far reach of your work and the positive impact of your authorship.


Validation of our work: this is how a book ends up looking when it is used often.


Penny, you and your team deserve perhaps more credit and recognition than have ever been given to a publisher. Under your leadership, the group (Lauren
Harms [Developmental Editor], Rachel McMullen [Senior Project Manager], Catherine Jackson [Publication Services Manager], Bruce Siebert [Senior Producer],
and Lynn Hoops [Marketing Manager]) has exceeded my every expectation from the earliest planning stages onward. No one could hope for a kinder, more
gratifying, and more effective approach for bringing the book together. It has been a pleasure, and my wish for other authors is that they be as fortunate as I
have been to work with such a determined, proactive, and fun group.


With or without realizing it, many individuals made this book possible by helping me personally during its creation. My mentor, Steve Ettinger, was unfailing in his
constructive criticisms and support. Unbeknownst to him, his candid observations led to many improvements in this edition, both large and small. His positive
feedback and kindness during the creation of this book are irreplaceable. Thank you as always, Steve. Elizabeth Charuvastra RN, CEO of Targeted Medical
Pharma LLC, stepped in and offered me an editor's dream (office space and support) while I was in California during the final stages of completion of the book. I
could not have imagined a better-timed or more welcome gift, Liz. Many, many thanks. Similarly, my good friend and colleague Kirstie Barrett made it possible
for me to have an immediately-usable work space during my West coast visit, and for this I am truly grateful. My friend David Edward gets a testimony of
gratitude for providing an industrial quantity of PG Tips tea. Many thanks to Richard, Deirdre, and Evan Denis for hospitality during multiple layovers in Toronto. I
also wish to thank all readers who sent me feedback aimed at making the second edition better. These messages from the front lines of practice helped reshape
some of the content of this edition for the better, as readers will see for themselves.


I thank all members of the Atlantic Veterinary College who contributed directly or indirectly, especially my colleagues who provided feedback, the technical staff
(notably Elaine Reveler) who made it possible to generate good images and graphics, and the administration and faculty association who provided the
framework and support for my academic work and sabbatical leave to dedicate time to the _Advisor_ specifically.


Last and most personally, I thank my family for their support and understanding. An endeavor such as this book is built on sacrifices, and their acceptance of my
well-worn refrain, “I can't—I have a deadline,” was the epitome of support. François, Diane, Antoine, and above all Jennifer: thank you.


5-Fluorouracil Toxicosis Página 1 de 3


**5-Fluorouracil Toxicosis**


**BASIC INFORMATION**


**DEFINITION**


Adverse effects caused by exposure to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a pyrimidine analog-type antineoplastic antimetabolite drug used for palliative management of certain
carcinomas in humans and occasionally in dogs.


**SYNONYMS**


Common brand names: Efudex, Fluoroplex, and Carac. Generic: 2,4-dioxo-5-fluoropyrimidine; 5-fluoro-2,4(1H,3H); pyrimidinedione; 5-FU; NSC 19893; Ro2-9757;
CAS 51-21-8.


**EPIDEMIOLOGY**


**SPECIES, AGE, SEX**


Dogs and cats of any age, breed, and either sex. Dog cases are more common. Dogs are more likely to develop neurologic effects (seizures) compared to
humans. Cats are more sensitive to toxic effects of 5-FU than dogs.


**RISK FACTORS**


`�` Preexisting liver or kidney dysfunction can increase risk of toxicity

`�` Presence of 5-FU in a pet's environment


**CLINICAL PRESENTATION**


**HISTORY, CHIEF COMPLAINT**


`�` History of exposure to product containing 5-FU

`�` Clinical signs begin within 30 minutes to 5 hours of exposure.

`�` Vomiting, hypersalivation, lethargy, vocalization, diarrhea, tremors, ataxia, seizures

`�` Some animals show vomiting progressing quickly to seizures; others may show tremors and seizures and no vomiting.


**PHYSICAL EXAM FINDINGS**


`�` Seizures (often status epilepticus)

`�` Vomiting (with or without blood)

`�` Diarrhea (with or without blood)

`�` Tremors

`�` Lethargy

`�` Ataxia

`�` Cardiac arrhythmias (all kinds)

`�` Respiratory depression


**ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY**


_Source_


5-FU or similar agents are available for use as injection, topical creams (0.5%-5%) or lotions (1%-5%), and capecitabine (prodrug of fluorouracil) as tablets.
Flucytosine is an antifungal agent that must be converted to 5-FU.


Toxicosis occurs after ingestion of products containing 5-FU and occasionally secondary to repeated use in dogs or cats.


_Mechanism of Toxicosis_


5-FU inhibits RNA processing and function and DNA synthesis and repair, inhibiting cell division. Actively dividing cell lines (bone marrow stem cells, intestinal
crypt cells) are most affected.


The mechanism of neurotoxicity may be production of fluorocitrate, which limits cellular energy production by interfering with the Krebs cycle.


**DIAGNOSIS**

5-Fluorouracil Toxicosis Página 2 de 3


History of exposure and presence of clinical signs consistent with exposure to 5-FU within 30 minutes to 5 hours after exposure


**DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**


Diseases or intoxications that could cause vomiting (see p. 1173) and/or seizures (see pp. 1009 and 1425)


**INITIAL DATABASE**


`�` Serum biochemistry profile (elevated liver enzymes, azotemia possible in 24 hours)

`�` Electrolytes (hypokalemia possible due to severe vomiting, diarrhea)

`�` CBC with differential (baseline, monitor q 24-72 hours for 20 days); initial leukocytosis followed by evidence of myelosuppression, leukopenia,
pancytopenia in 5-20 days. Hematocrit increased due to dehydration then decreased due to gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.

`�` Blood gas analysis

`�` Urinalysis


**ADVANCED OR CONFIRMATORY TESTING**


`�` Analysis of 5-FU and its metabolites in plasma is possible but often difficult to obtain in timely fashion for acute toxicoses.

`�` Necropsy lesions: hemorrhagic colitis, GI mucosal ulceration (throughout), stomatitis, myocardial ischemia, pulmonary edema, hepatic and renal
congestion


**TREATMENT**


**TREATMENT OVERVIEW**


Stabilize the patient first; control vomiting and seizures. Provide supportive care once the animal has been stabilized.


**ACUTE GENERAL TREATMENT**


`�` Decontamination of asymptomatic patient

`�` Emesis using activated charcoal with a cathartic if patient is showing no clinical signs and the ingestion is recent (<1 hour)

`�` Hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or fluid diuresis may enhance elimination

`�` Manage vomiting

`�` Maropitant, 1 mg/kg SQ q 24 h for up to 5 consecutive days

`�` Do not use metoclopramide (contraindicated with GI hemorrhage and seizure disorder)

`�` GI protection

`�` Sucralfate, 0.5 (small dog) to 1 gram (large dog) PO q 8 h

`�` Famotidine, 0.5-1 mg/kg IV or PO q 12-24 h; or omeprazole, 0.5-1 mg/kg PO q 24 h

`�` Manage tremors and seizures (see p. 1009)

`�` Seizures are rarely controlled with diazepam alone (dogs: 2-5 mg/kg IV; cats: 0.5-1 mg/kg IV). If seizures persist after diazepam therapy, give
phenobarbital IV bolus, 2-5 mg/kg (can be repeated at 20-minute intervals up to two times). May then add phenobarbital IV infusion (2-10 mg/hour
IV, titrated to effect) to diazepam; _or_

`�` Pentobarbital, 3-15 mg/kg IV slowly to effect; _or_

`�` Propofol, 4-6 mg/kg IV or as continuous IV infusion 0.6 mg/kg/min; _or_

`�` Gas anesthesia

`�` Intravenous fluids

`�` Thermoregulation (correct hypothermia)

`�` Ventilatory support as needed

`�` Maintain normal acid-base status and electrolyte balance

`�` Manage pain

`�` Butorphanol, 0.2-0.4 mg/kg q 2-5 h SQ, IM, or IV (dogs); 0.1-1 mg/kg IM, IV, or SQ q 1-3 h (cats); or tramadol, 1-4 mg/kg PO q 6-8 h; or
buprenorphine, 0.005-0.05 mg/kg, IM, IV q 4-8 h; _or_ fentanyl patch

`�` Consider giving broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent secondary infection.

`�` For neutropenia: filgrastim (Neupogen), 4-6 mcg/kg SQ


**CHRONIC TREATMENT**


Intensive supportive care may be needed for days/weeks, especially if myelosuppression occurs.


**NUTRITION/DIET**


Tube feeding or bland diet if GI signs


**DRUG INTERACTIONS**


Metronidazole may increase toxicity of 5-FU by reducing clearance.

5-Fluorouracil Toxicosis Página 3 de 3


**POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS OF TREATMENT OR DISEASE PROCESS**


`�` Severe brain damage from uncontrolled seizures

`�` Neutropenia, pancytopenia, myelosuppression (in 5-20 days)


**RECOMMENDED MONITORING**


`�` Heart rate, blood pressure

`�` Respiratory rate and character

`�` CBC (myelosuppression in 5-20 days), serum biochemistry profile (liver and kidney function)

`�` Blood gases


**PROGNOSIS AND OUTCOME**


Guarded to poor, once signs occur. Out of 72 cases of 5-FU toxicosis, 35 dogs died and 11 were euthanized.


**PEARLS & CONSIDERATIONS**


**COMMENTS**


`�` Severe signs or death can result from 5-FU toxicosis; early decontamination and immediate, intensive treatment are essential, and owners should be
advised of the seriousness of exposure to 5-FU.

`�` Estimated toxic dose likely to cause clinical signs in dogs: 8.6 mg/kg PO. Minimum lethal dose in dogs: 20 mg/kg PO. If a 70-lb dog (32 kg) ingests 1
tablespoon (15 g) from a tube containing 5% 5-FU, the dose of 5-FU in this dog will be approximately 23 mg/kg, a potentially lethal dose.


**PREVENTION**


Keep medications out of pets’ reach


**TECHNICIAN TIPS**


Estimating the ingested amount by obtaining a good history of exposure may predict the prognosis early on.


**CLIENT EDUCATION**


5-FU toxicosis in pets can be life threatening.

Abdominal Compartment Syndrome Página 1 de 3


**Abdominal Compartment Syndrome**


**BASIC INFORMATION**


**DEFINITION**


Impaired organ function resulting from increased intraabdominal pressure (IAP >20 mm Hg). This syndrome is likely underrecognized in veterinary medicine and
has a high prevalence in human ICU patients.


**SYNONYMS**


ACS, increased IAP, intraabdominal hypertension (IAH)


**EPIDEMIOLOGY**


**SPECIES, AGE, SEX**


No species, age, sex, genetic, or breed predisposition


**RISK FACTORS**


`�` Any patient with abdominal disease or accumulations of fluid, gas, or tissue in the abdominal cavity can develop elevated IAP.

`�` Specific risk factors include underlying diseases that lead to gas or fluid accumulation in the abdominal compartment (within organs, viscera or as free
fluid) or interfere with the abdominal wall's ability to expand and compensate for increased abdominal contents.

`�` Abdominal effusion

`�` Abdominal neoplasia

`�` Abdominal surgery or trauma (most common causes)

`�` Abdominal wraps/bandages

`�` Decreased abdominal wall compliance (edema, hematoma, muscle activity)

`�` Hepatic abscess

`�` High-volume fluid resuscitation

`�` Ileus

`�` Pancreatitis

`�` Peritonitis

`�` Sepsis


**CLINICAL PRESENTATION**


**DISEASE FORMS/SUBTYPES**


`�` Primary ACS: intraabdominal cause, most commonly postoperative or trauma patients

`�` Secondary ACS: extraabdominal cause, most commonly sepsis or burn patients that require aggressive fluid resuscitation

`�` Recurrent ACS: redevelopment of ACS after surgical or medical treatment for primary or secondary ACS


**HISTORY, CHIEF COMPLAINT**


`�` Frequent history of abdominal trauma or surgery

`�` Indications to check IAP are (usually in combination):

`�` New or progressive organ failure

`�` Particularly azotemia, reduced urine output

`�` Elevated central venous, mean arterial, right and left atrial pressures

`�` Rising intracranial pressure, altered mentation

`�` New vomiting and diarrhea

`�` Acidosis, rising blood lactate levels


**PHYSICAL EXAM FINDINGS**


`�` Physical examination and abdominal perimeter (girth) measurements are insensitive for detecting elevated IAP.

`�` Progressive abdominal distension or tympany, jugular vein distension, tachypnea, tachycardia are possible


**ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY**


`�` IAP in healthy adults is subatmospheric − 0 mm Hg; IAP in critically ill adults is 5-7 mm Hg.

`�` IAH is defined as a sustained elevation in IAP = 12 mm Hg.

`�` ACS (sustained IAP > 20 mm Hg with new organ dysfunction/failure) develops if IAH is not recognized and treated.


http://www.clinicalvetadvisor2.com/html/bc/ch002s001_s001_s002.php 21-09-2011


Abdominal Compartment Syndrome Página 2 de 3


`�` ACS is not a disease, but a distinct syndrome of clinical signs and abnormalities that can have multiple causes.

`�` At low intraabdominal volumes, the abdominal wall is very compliant. Large increases in abdominal volume result in minor increases in IAP. At higher
abdominal volumes, abdominal wall compliance decreases, and even small increases in volume can cause major increases in IAP.

`�` Increased pressure in the abdomen leads to hypoperfusion and ischemia of abdominal organs and, when severe, direct compression of blood vessels.

This leads to alterations in renal (most recognized), hepatic, and gastrointestinal functions. Anuria can occur with IAP > 30 mm Hg. Liver function, including
cytochrome P450 function, is impaired. Intestinal edema can develop, as well as bacterial translocation through gastrointestinal walls.

`�` Reduced ability for the diaphragm to contract against the tense abdomen impairs tidal volume and compromises ventilation, resulting in hypoxia and
hypercapnia. Mechanical/positive pressure ventilation is similarly affected.
