`�` Cats appear to be at greater risk for cancer cachexia than dogs: up to 90% of cats with neoplastic disease experience clinically apparent loss of lean
body mass.


**ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS & DISORDERS**


Cancer cachexia is a form of protein-energy malnutrition, the most common form of malnutrition found in critically ill animals and people. It occurs when protein
and energy intake is insufficient to meet requirements. Protein-energy malnutrition is associated with hypoproteinemia, delayed wound healing,
immunosuppression, and compromised gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and cardiovascular function. Multiorgan failure and death will be the eventual outcome
unless nutritional support is provided and the primary underlying disease process is resolved.


**CLINICAL PRESENTATION**


**HISTORY, CHIEF COMPLAINT**


Although weight loss is the primary abnormality in all cats and dogs with cancer cachexia, specific historical findings differ substantially from animal to animal.
Weight loss may be mild to profound in severity, ranging from acute to chronic in duration. Weight loss is also superimposed on any clinical signs associated with
the underlying neoplastic disease, which vary with the specific diagnosis.


**PHYSICAL EXAM FINDINGS**


Physical exam findings in animals with cancer cachexia can be divided into two groups: abnormalities related to cancer cachexia, and abnormalities caused by
the animal's underlying cancer. The clinical signs associated with cancer cachexia are nonspecific, initially may be subtle, and can easily be overlooked.
Findings may include muscle wasting, pallor, weakness, poor haircoat, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, evidence of chronic infections, and lymphadenopathy.
Peripheral edema could be present in severe cases. Physical exam findings related to the underlying malignancy are highly variable and depend on the animal's
specific histopathologic diagnosis and stage of disease. No two animals with cancer cachexia have exactly the same presentation.


**ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY**


`�` The etiology of cancer cachexia is highly variable and multifactorial.

`�` There are two major categories of cancer cachexia: primary and secondary.

`�` Primary cancer cachexia is an incompletely understood paraneoplastic syndrome in which tumor-related changes in host metabolism lead to inefficient
use of consumed calories, in turn leading to gradual depletion of lean body mass and adipose stores. No matter how many calories are fed or by what
route, host requirements cannot be met.

`�` Recent studies suggest that primary cancer cachexia may be an inflammatory disorder caused by alterations in proinflammatory mediators such as
interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- α ), and various eicosanoids.

`�` Secondary cancer cachexia is caused by one or more of a variety of functional abnormalities that decrease nutrient intake, digestion, or absorption.
Examples include the physical presence of tumor within the digestive tract, causing gastrointestinal dysfunction, or side effects of radiotherapy or
chemotherapy such as stomatitis, vomiting, and gastroenteritis.


**DIAGNOSIS**


**DIAGNOSTIC OVERVIEW**


Dogs and cats with cancer-associated cachexia have objective evidence of loss of lean body mass and adipose stores as demonstrated by weight loss and a
decline in body condition score.


**DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

**TREATMENT**


**TREATMENT OVERVIEW**


The basic goals of therapy in the cat or dog suffering from cancer cachexia are twofold:


`�` Return the animal to ideal body condition.

`�` Maintain the animal in ideal body condition long term.


These goals are accomplished by diagnosing and treating the underlying malignancy and providing appropriate nutritional support.


**ACUTE GENERAL TREATMENT**


`�` Cancer cachexia is a paraneoplastic syndrome, so eradication of the underlying neoplastic disease is the best treatment. This goal can be met by:

`�` Obtaining a rapid and accurate definitive diagnosis of neoplasia, including neoplasm type and clinical stage

`�` Initiating timely and effective antineoplastic therapy

`�` An individualized feeding protocol is instituted concurrently and is based on the animal's nutritional assessment as defined by the minimum database
outlined previously.


**CHRONIC TREATMENT**


Nutritional recommendations are adjusted as necessary based on repeat nutritional assessment, with the goal of maintaining ideal body condition:


`�` Food intake is increased or decreased as needed in response to changes in body weight and condition.

`�` Assisted feeding can be used intermittently to maintain nutrient intake.

`�` The specific ration recommended for an individual animal may change depending on the progression of the underlying neoplastic disease and concurrent

conditions.


**NUTRITION/DIET**


`�` Components of the feeding protocol for an animal with cancer-associated cachexia must include:

`�` Fluid requirement in milliliters per day


http://www.clinicalvetadvisor2.com/html/bc/ch002s001_s003_s001.php 24-09-2011


Cachexia, Cancer-Associated Página 3 de 3


`�` Energy requirement in kilocalories per day

`�` A choice of commercial ration that meets the animal's needs:

`�` Calories appropriately distributed among protein, fat, and carbohydrate

`�` All necessary nutrients (i.e., vitamins and minerals) present in correct quantities and ratios

`�` A method of feeding that will be tolerated by the animal

`�` No single diet is appropriate for every animal with cancer cachexia, because underlying disease, nutritional status, and nutrient requirements are highly
variable from case to case.

`�` Rations with ample protein and fat are often recommended for weight-losing cats and dogs with cancer.

`�` Individual restriction of protein, fat, or carbohydrate intake may be indicated, depending on preexisting or concurrent conditions such as renal or
hepatic insufficiency, pancreatitis, or diabetes mellitus.

`�` Voluntary intake is the most practical feeding technique, but quantities of food and water consumed must be measured to ensure that requirements are
actually met.

`�` Assisted feeding should be instituted without delay in animals unable to meet their own nutrient requirements.

`�` Assisted enteral feeding using some type of feeding tube is usually preferred, because it allows nutrients to be metabolized through normal pathways and

is more effective in maintaining gut health.

`�` Fluid deficits and electrolyte or acid-base imbalances should be corrected before any type of assisted feeding is attempted.


**POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS**


`�` Gastrointestinal intolerance

`�` See online chapter: Refeeding Syndrome


**RECOMMENDED MONITORING**


`�` Nutritional assessment, including diet history, body weight, and body condition score, should be repeated at regular intervals.

`�` Diagnostics are repeated as indicated based on underlying neoplastic disease and nutritional status; this commonly includes CBC, serum biochemistry
profile, urinalysis, and imaging studies.


**PROGNOSIS AND OUTCOME**


`�` Cancer cachexia has a well-documented negative effect on quality of life and prognosis in people, and its impact is highly likely to be the same in cats
and dogs.

`�` Increased incidence and severity of treatment-related toxicities, lower treatment response rates, shorter remission durations, and shorter survival times
should be expected in weight-losing animals when compared to weight-stable animals with the same tumor.


**PEARLS & CONSIDERATIONS**


**COMMENTS**


`�` Several studies now show that many dogs with cancer are actually obese. Indiscriminate use of high-fat diets in these animals will simply promote

additional weight gain and its associated health problems. The primary goal of nutritional therapy in any cat or dog with cancer is always to maintain ideal
body weight and condition.

`�` Recent work suggests that cats with cancer are more likely to have weight loss than dogs. However, it is not yet clear if this weight loss is specifically
related to the presence of underlying neoplastic disease, or if it is a generic response to critical illness in the cat.

TECHNICIAN TIPS


The use of a compound microscope to detect the presence of the unique first-stage larvae with their characteristic long tails is the
key to diagnosis.


CLIENT EDUCATION


Dogs should never be allowed to roam freely, thus avoiding contact with infested water.
