Cachexia, Cardiac Página 1 de 3


**Cachexia, Cardiac**


**BASIC INFORMATION**


**DEFINITION**


Weight and lean tissue loss commonly associated with congestive heart failure (CHF)


**EPIDEMIOLOGY**


**SPECIES, AGE, SEX**


More common in dogs than in cats


**RISK FACTORS**


More common in right-sided or biventricular than in isolated left-sided CHF but can occur regardless of underlying cause


**ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS & DISORDERS**


Occurs secondary to CHF


**CLINICAL PRESENTATION**


**DISEASE FORMS/SUBTYPES**


Cachexia ranges in severity from subtle muscle loss to severe, end-stage muscle wasting.


**HISTORY, CHIEF COMPLAINT**


Heart failure (see p. 470)


**PHYSICAL EXAM FINDINGS**


`�` Loss of lean body mass first noted in epaxial, gluteal, scapular, or temporal muscles; may be subtle initially

`�` Carefully palpate obese animals and animals with ascites or subcutaneous edema to determine whether muscle loss is present.


**ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY**


`�` Cardiac cachexia reduces strength, immune function, and survival.

`�` Decreased food intake, increased energy requirements, and production of the inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 1 (IL-1)

`�` TNF and IL-1 cause anorexia, increased energy requirements, catabolism of lean body mass, myocardial fibrosis, and decreased cardiac
contractility (negative inotropy).


**DIAGNOSIS**


**DIAGNOSTIC OVERVIEW**


All animals with CHF should be assessed carefully for early signs of muscle loss so that cachexia can be detected at its early stages when intervention is more
likely to be successful.


**DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**


Cachexia from other diseases (e.g., cancer, renal failure)


**INITIAL DATABASE**


`�` Diet history, including specific types and amounts of food eaten, dietary supplements, treats, and foods used for administering medications

`�` Evaluation for potential causes of anorexia (e.g., worsening CHF; medication side effects such as azotemia, hyperkalemia, or hypotension; unpalatable
diet)


**TREATMENT**


**TREATMENT OVERVIEW**


The goals of treating cardiac cachexia are to (1) optimally manage CHF, (2) minimize anorexia, (3) reduce energy requirements, (4) ensure adequate protein
intake, and (5) modulate cytokine production.


**ACUTE GENERAL TREATMENT**


`�` In acute CHF episodes, avoid diet changes until the patient is home and stabilized on medications.

`�` To avoid food aversions, introduce new diet gradually when patient is stabilized.

Cachexia, Cardiac Página 2 de 3


**CHRONIC TREATMENT**


`�` Ensure optimal medical therapy for CHF (see p.470).

`�` Nutritional management is key to the effective chronic treatment of cardiac cachexia (see below).


**NUTRITION/DIET**


`�` Tips to minimize anorexia (see p.1377):

`�` Reduced sodium diet palatable to individual patient may require diet changes (e.g., dry to canned, or different brand or flavor).

`�` Balanced homemade diet formulated by veterinary nutritionist

`�` Smaller, more frequent meals

`�` Palatability enhancers (cooked meat or low-sodium broth)

`�` Fish oil supplementation (see “Modulate cytokine production” below)

`�` Reduce energy requirements:

`�` Optimal management of CHF

`�` Exercise restriction

`�` Ensure adequate protein intake:

`�` Avoid protein-restricted diets (e.g., “renal” diets or cardiac diets with <5.1 g/100 kcal protein)

`�` Modulate cytokine production:

`�` Administer one 1-gram fish oil capsule (containing 180 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and 120 mg docosahexaenoic acid) per 5 kg body weight q 24
h.

`�` Fish oil should contain vitamin E as an antioxidant, but no other nutrients.

`�` Cod liver oil and flaxseed oil should not be used (ineffective).


**DRUG INTERACTIONS**


Medication side effects can contribute to cachexia by causing anorexia (e.g., digoxin toxicity, azotemia secondary to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or
overzealous diuretic use).


**RECOMMENDED MONITORING**


`�` Body weight (be sure to adjust for ascites) and assessment of muscle loss

`�` Appetite and food intake


**PROGNOSIS AND OUTCOME**


Prognosis depends on the underlying cardiac disease. However, anorexia is a common contributing factor to an owner's decision for euthanasia.


**PEARLS & CONSIDERATIONS**


**COMMENTS**


`�` Animals with CHF often have variable and cyclical appetites. Reassure owners that this is common, and that they can offer favorite (low-sodium) foods
when this occurs. However, anorexia longer than 24-48 hours should trigger reevaluation of CHF and medications.

`�` Centesis should be performed on anorectic animals with a significant ascites or pleural effusion to reduce fluid accumulation (for comfort).

`�` Animals with CHF may prefer foods at a particular temperature (e.g., room temperature, warmed, refrigerated, or even frozen).

`�` Dogs with CHF often prefer sweet tastes, particularly as the disease progresses. Adding items such as maple syrup, fruit-flavored yogurt, or applesauce
to the dog's food may improve food intake.


**PREVENTION**


`�` None known

`�` Early detection in more subtle stages

`�` Minimize by ensuring adequate food intake and optimal therapy for CHF


**CLIENT EDUCATION**


`�` Sodium intake:

`�` Provide owner-specific instructions regarding foods high in sodium (to be avoided), appropriate dog foods, acceptable low-salt treats, and
methods for administering medications.

`�` Appetite:

`�` Provide the owner with suggestions for improving the animal's appetite (see Nutrition/Diet above and ).

Cachexia, Cancer-Associated Página 1 de 3


**Cachexia, Cancer-Associated**


**BASIC INFORMATION**


**DEFINITION**


The term _cancer cachexia_ refers to weight loss in an animal or person with underlying neoplastic disease. Classic defining clinical features of the syndrome
include severe involuntary weight loss, fatigue, anemia, and progressive depletion of both lean body mass and adipose stores.


**SYNONYM**


Cancer-associated weight loss


**EPIDEMIOLOGY**


**SPECIES, AGE, SEX**


Cancer cachexia has been reported in association with neoplastic disease in many species, including people, cats, and dogs with naturally occurring
malignancies, as well as laboratory rodents bearing implanted tumors. Animals of any age and either sex may be affected.


**RISK FACTORS**


`�` Advanced clinical stage of neoplastic disease

`�` Tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach, and pancreas) in humans

`�` Lower risk in people with treatment-responsive lymphomas, soft-tissue sarcomas, and breast cancer

`�` Cancer cachexia is less common in dogs than in people.

`�` Cats appear to be at greater risk for cancer cachexia than dogs: up to 90% of cats with neoplastic disease experience clinically apparent loss of lean
body mass.


**ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS & DISORDERS**


Cancer cachexia is a form of protein-energy malnutrition, the most common form of malnutrition found in critically ill animals and people. It occurs when protein
and energy intake is insufficient to meet requirements. Protein-energy malnutrition is associated with hypoproteinemia, delayed wound healing,
immunosuppression, and compromised gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and cardiovascular function. Multiorgan failure and death will be the eventual outcome
unless nutritional support is provided and the primary underlying disease process is resolved.
