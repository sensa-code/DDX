Aberrant Adrenocortical Disease (Increased Adrenal Sex Hormone Production) Página 1 de 3


**Aberrant Adrenocortical Disease (Increased Adrenal Sex**
**Hormone Production)**


**BASIC INFORMATION**


**DEFINITION**


Clinical signs of hyperadrenocorticism are present, but cortisol test results are normal, and one or more of the adrenal sex hormones is/are increased.


**SYNONYMS**


Atypical hyperadrenocorticism, sex hormone abnormality


**EPIDEMIOLOGY**


**SPECIES, AGE, SEX**


Middle-aged/old dogs and cats


**ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS AND DISORDERS**


Hyperadrenocorticism


**CLINICAL PRESENTATION**


**DISEASE FORMS/SUBTYPES**


`�` Pituitary dependent

`�` Adrenal dependent: adrenal carcinoma has mainly been reported (two cats and six dogs with hyperprogesteronism)


**HISTORY, CHIEF COMPLAINT**


Identical to hyperadrenocorticism (see p. 548)


**PHYSICAL EXAM FINDINGS**


Identical to hyperadrenocorticism (see p. 548)


**ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY**


`�` The adrenal gland(s) secretes an excessive amount of one or more adrenal sex hormones.

`�` Adrenal tumors (particularly adenocarcinomas) may secrete adrenal sex hormones owing to disruption of adrenal tissue.

`�` Progestagens can act as glucocorticoid agonists.

`�` Cortisol concentrations may be normal to subnormal with sex hormone-secreting adrenal tumors, as high progestagen concentrations can suppress
cortisol secretion.


**DIAGNOSIS**


**DIAGNOSTIC OVERVIEW**


The disorder is suspected when typical signs of hyperadrenocorticism are identified, but specific diagnostic tests (e.g., ACTH stimulation) are inconsistent with
hyperadrenocorticism. Confirmation is obtained with identification of elevated serum levels of adrenal sex hormones.


**DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**


`�` Polyuria/Polydipsia (see p. 902)

`�` Polyphagia (see p. 899)

`�` Alopecia (see pp. 54 and 56)


**INITIAL DATABASE**


Hyperadrenocorticism (see p. 548)


**ADVANCED OR CONFIRMATORY TESTING**

Aberrant Adrenocortical Disease (Increased Adrenal Sex Hormone Production) Página 2 de 3


`�` Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test with sex hormone panel (progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, estradiol, androstenedione,
testosterone):

`�` Dogs with nonadrenal illness may have mildly increased adrenal sex hormones.

`�` Substantial overlap in sex hormone serum concentrations between healthy, nonadrenally ill, and hyperadrenocorticism patients make sex hormone

assays ineffective screening tests for hypercortisolism.

`�` Approximately 71% sensitivity and specificity for 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations if a cutoff greater than 8.5 ng/mL is used for diagnosing
atypical hyperadrenocorticism

`�` Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test to rule out typical hyperadrenocorticism ± endogenous ACTH concentrations, CT, MRI (see p. 548)


**TREATMENT**


**TREATMENT OVERVIEW**


Resolution of clinical signs is the goal of treatment; medications are typically used for controlling pituitary-based disease, and surgical excision is the treatment of
choice for primary adrenal tumors.


**ACUTE GENERAL TREATMENT**


`�` See Adrenal Neoplasia (Adenoma/Carcinoma), p. 43

`�` Pituitary-dependent (see p. 548)


**CHRONIC TREATMENT**


`�` As for hyperadrenocorticism, p. 548

`�` The following recommended by some, with anecdotally supported results (see

http://www.vet.utk.edu/diagnostic/endocrinology/pdf/TreatmentInfoAtypicalCushingsRevised201001.pdf):

`�` Melatonin (3-6 mg/dog PO q 12 h, based on body weight); inhibits aromatase and 21-hydroxylase enzymes

`�` Melatonin implants (www.melatek.net) 8, 12, 18 mg for dogs weighing <25, 25-50, and >50 lb, respectively

`�` Lignan (from flaxseed hulls or HMR lignan) ≈ 2 mg/kg PO q 24 h; phytoestrogenic activity inhibits aromatase

`�` Elimination of exogenous (e.g., hormone cream) or endogenous (ovarian remnant, cryptorchid testicle) sources of androgens


**DRUG INTERACTIONS**


See Hyperadrenocorticism, p. 548; Adrenal Neoplasia (Adenoma/Carcinoma), p. 43


**POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS**


See Hyperadrenocorticism, p. 548; Adrenal Neoplasia (Adenoma/Carcinoma), p. 43


**RECOMMENDED MONITORING**


Medical therapy: ACTH stimulation testing every 3 months


`�` Mitotane (o,p ‘-DDD) therapy: sex hormone concentrations (and cortisol if also increased) should decrease to normal.

`�` Trilostane therapy: progesterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations may increase concurrent with resolution of clinical signs and a decrease in
cortisol concentrations.


**PROGNOSIS AND OUTCOME**


`�` Survival data unknown but subjectively similar to dogs with typical hyperadrenocorticism

`�` Adrenal tumor: good if surgically resectable

`�` Pituitary-dependent: good with treatment


**PEARLS & CONSIDERATIONS**


**COMMENTS**


`�` Limited information is available regarding this disease and the sensitivity and specificity of adrenal sex hormones in nonadrenal illness.

`�` Adrenal sex hormones are also increased in dogs with typical hyperadrenocorticism (i.e., hypercortisolemia).


**TECHNICIAN TIP**


On both the pre- and post-ACTH stimulated serum, 2 mL of serum are required. Centrifuge, separate, and freeze the serum as soon as possible. Avoid
submission of hemolyzed samples.

Abortion, Dog Página 1 de 4


**Abortion, Dog**


**BASIC INFORMATION**


**DEFINITION**


`�` The expulsion of one or more fetuses before full term pregnancy. Uncommon; in the dog, resorption is more common. Occurs more often during the fetal
period.

`�` Induction of abortion (pregnancy termination): see p. 912.


**SYNONYMS**


Fetal loss, pregnancy wastage


**EPIDEMIOLOGY**


**SPECIES, AGE, SEX**


Female dog; no specific age


**GENETICS & BREED PREDISPOSITION**


Inbreeding (inbreeding coefficient >0.25): early embryonic death, conceptus resorption


**RISK FACTORS**


`�` History of previous pregnancy loss

`�` Malnutrition (pregnancy ketosis)

`�` Endocrinopathies (hypothyroidism, hypoluteoidism, diabetes mellitus)

`�` Infection _(Brucella canis, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus canis, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter_ sp., _Leptospira_ sp. _Salmonella_ sp., _Mycoplasma_
sp., canine herpesvirus 1, canine parvovirus 1 [minute virus of canines], bluetongue virus, canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus [infectious hepatitis],
_Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania infantum)_

`�` Unsolicited treatment with endocrine disruptors, embryotoxic or teratogenic compounds (e.g., antifungal agents such as itraconazole or polyester textiles in

contact with skin).

`�` Inadequate vaccination or deworming programs


**CONTAGION & ZOONOSIS**


`�` _Brucella canis_ is zoonotic. _Salmonella_ sp. and _Leptospira_ sp. have zoonotic potential.

`�` Canine herpesvirus 1 and minute virus of canines: transmission through direct contact via aerosol or contact with aborted fetuses and/or placentas. Maleto-female venereal contact is not a significant means of viral transmission.


**GEOGRAPHY AND SEASONALITY**


`�` Canine brucellosis: endemic in parts of North and South America; eradicated in Europe since 1996.

`�` Canine herpesvirus: worldwide incidence; serologic prevalence of 60%-80%.


**ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS & DISORDERS**


Abortion may be secondary to fetal death.


**CLINICAL PRESENTATION**


**HISTORY, CHIEF COMPLAINT**


`�` Pregnant bitch whelps prematurely with live or dead pups, or no pups are born at term.

`�` Abnormal vulvar discharge during pregnancy (bloody or purulent discharge), fever, or signs of abdominal pain may be noted by owner.

`�` Usually abortion in the bitch goes unnoticed by the owner because the dam may consume the pups and the aborted tissues.

`�` Death may occur in one or more fetuses, whereas the remainder may continue to develop normally.

`�` Late-term abortions (between days 45 and 59) are typical of _B. canis_ .


**PHYSICAL EXAM FINDINGS**


`�` Often unremarkable

`�` Vulvar discharge occurs normally in pregnant bitches and is clear to mucoid or pink-tinged and odorless; purulent, hemorrhagic, greenish, blackish, or

malodorous vulvar discharge may indicate pregnancy complications that could lead to abortion.

Abortion, Dog Página 2 de 4


**ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY**


`�` Canine pregnancy requires normal luteal function throughout its duration. Any toxic or hormonal substance that induces endogenous release of
prostaglandin F-2 alpha (PGF2a) and subsequent luteolysis may cause abortion (e.g., bacterial toxins [coliforms, _Staphylococcus_ sp.], adrenergic agonists

[e.g., phenylephrine]).

`�` Fetal survival requires normal placental function and placental relaxin production. Relaxin concentration declines rapidly after the death of all fetuses but
may remain elevated for some days after the loss of pregnancy.

`�` Pathogens that influence placental function (e.g., herpesvirus placentitis) may cause abortion.


**DIAGNOSIS**


**DIAGNOSTIC OVERVIEW**


The diagnosis is suspected when the pregnancy is previously confirmed on ultrasound or by radiography, and the bitch then presents nonpregnant or expelled
fetuses have been observed.


**DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**


`�` Pseudocyesis (false pregnancy). Ultrasound evaluation on days 23-25 following breeding to confirm pregnancy and fetal heart beat.

`�` Vulvar discharge due to vaginitis or metritis (pyometra). Ultrasound evaluation of uterine disorders may be useful on days 23-25 of anticipated gestation.


**INITIAL DATABASE**


`�` Serologic testing of affected dam.

`�` _B. canis:_ Rapid slide agglutination test (RSAT) is an excellent screening test, but false-positive results occur. To reduce cross-reactivity and false
positive results, 2-mercaptoethanol can be added to the RSAT. Dogs in a positive kennel or household that are negative on first test should be
retested once a month for 3 consecutive months to confirm negative status. Vaginal secretions or semen can be tested by PCR to determine a
positive _B. canis_ status before seroconversion occurs.

`�` CHV-1: A serum neutralization test or ELISA test with a positive result greater than 1:16 is indicative of prior infection (exposure).

`�` Virus or bacterial isolation from microbial cultures from fetuses, placenta, milk, or vaginal secretions.

`�` _B. canis:_ Repeated samples may be necessary. Antibiotics are usually ineffective because of the intracellular location of the infectious organism.

`�` In acute CHV-1 infections, viral isolation from infected tissues is possible for 2-3 weeks. Nasal or vaginal swabs may also be tested by PCR.
Typically titers show 1:64-1:640. Two blood samples (acute and convalescent) at 1-month intervals are suggested to confirm a decline or rise in
titer.

`�` Fetal gross necropsy (e.g., subcapsular hemorrhages in the kidneys indicative of CHV1) and visual inspection of associated fetal membranes

`�` Histologic assessment of fetal organs, liver, spleen, thymus, kidneys, adrenals, intestines and stomach, heart, lung, thymus, and brain

`�` Bacteriologic cultures from fetal organs and reproductive tract of the bitch

`�` Serum progesterone level of dam must be >2-3 ng/mL (6-9 nmol/L) to sustain pregnancy. Concentrations below this threshold for more than 48 hours may
lead to pregnancy loss. Lower level at any time of pregnancy until day 55 indicates hypoluteoidism (luteal dysfunction/failure).

`�` When reported, hypoluteoidism generally occurs on days 25-35 past breeding (i.e., at the initiation of the fetal period). Since low progesterone level

may occur secondary to fetal death, the diagnosis of hypoluteoidism is based on a low serum progesterone level, positive effect of progesterone
supplementation in a bitch that once aborted, and absence of other risk factors, such as a possible genetic etiology.

`�` Thyroid hormone analyses: May reveal subclinical hypothyroidism aggravated to a clinically significant disease during periods of stress, such as pregnancy

(see p. 588).

`�` Routine laboratory testing: CBC and serum biochemistry profile

`�` Normal hematocrit values: 45%-55% (nonpregnant) compared to 30%-35% (pregnant; due to an increase in plasma volume). Nonspecific

`�` Mild mature neutrophilia and hemoconcentration is normal in pregnant bitches, but an elevated presence of nonsegmented neutrophils or
monocytosis is abnormal.


**ADVANCED OR CONFIRMATORY TESTING**


`�` Ultrasonography may reveal fetal death before onset of abortion.

`�` Contact diagnostic laboratories for further recommendations for specific pathogens. For _B. canis_, blood culture with bacteriologic isolation provides a
definitive diagnosis and may be attempted after 5 weeks. If the RSAT is positive, an agarose gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test on cytoplasmic protein
antigens can be performed 12 weeks post infection and is the most accurate serologic test available.

`�` Toxicology of organs and/or blood when a specific toxin or drug is suspected


**TREATMENT**


**TREATMENT OVERVIEW**


`�` Acute supportive treatment of the bitch (e.g., intensive treatment of infection) is the main aim of treatment, since the prognosis for saving the ongoing
pregnancy is poor.

`�` _B. canis-_ infected dams should be euthanized or at least surgically sterilized, owing to the location of the organism in reproductive tissue. Premises should
be cleaned, kennelmates should be quarantined, and humans should avoid direct contact with excretions or aborted material from potentially infected
animals because of the zoonotic nature of _Brucella_ sp.

`�` In cases of hypoluteoidism (see serum progesterone above), progesterone supplementation may be attempted to try to prevent abortion of remaining

fetuses.

Abortion, Dog Página 3 de 4


**ACUTE GENERAL TREATMENT**


`�` Supportive: intravenous fluids (e.g., lactated Ringer's solution) and antibiotics if fever.

`�` Antibiotics: empirical pending culture and sensitivity results (if clinically feasible). Typical choices include amoxicillin (22 mg/kg PO q 8 h), cephalexin or
cefadroxil (20 mg PO q 8-12 h) or pivampicillin (30 mg/kg PO q 12 h). Enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg SQ, IM, or PO q 24 h) or trimethoprim/sulfadiazine (15 mg/kg
PO q 12 h) are broad spectrum but potentially teratogenic.

`�` See p. 909


**CHRONIC TREATMENT**


With confirmed hypoluteoidism, options include:


`�` Progesterone in oil 2 mg/kg IM q 48 h until 10 days before term

`�` Altrenogest 0.09 mg/kg PO q 24 h is an alternative.

`�` Micronized progesterone (Prometrium [Solvay Medical Pharmaceuticals, Marietta, GA, USA]) has been recommended; 10 mg/kg PO q 24 h.
Supplementation should be stopped at least 2 days prior to expected term (i.e., 60-61 days after the LH peak, to allow parturition).


If antibiotics are used in _B. canis-_ infected dogs, antibiotic treatment should be continued for at least 4 weeks, based on culture and sensitivity results and clinical
state.


**NUTRITION/DIET**


See p. 909. A good-quality maintenance diet is indicated.


**BEHAVIOR/EXERCISE**


Controlled physical activity during pregnancy


**DRUG INTERACTIONS**


Glucocorticoids are unpredictable abortifacient drugs in dogs.


**POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS**
