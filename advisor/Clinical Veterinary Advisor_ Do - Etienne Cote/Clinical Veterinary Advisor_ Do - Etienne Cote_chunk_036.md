Patients should be monitored closely after the application/administration of any of the above therapies, because desaturation and
worsening hypoxemia may occur. Decompensation may occur as a result of bronchoconstriction, incomplete mobilization of mucus
causing airway obstruction, tracheal irritation or exhaustion.


ALTERNATIVES AND THEIR RELATIVE MERITS


Metered dose inhaler (MDI; see p. 1289): is a more practical alternative for at home delivery of specific medications. Unfortunately,
only certain medications are routinely available in MDI form.

overlap of about 50% at each turn, to create the full length of the bandage. C, Conforming gauze is applied in same manner from distal to proximal but pulled tight at each turn. Cotton
should be evenly compressed. D, Tape stirrups are reflected proximally and stuck to bandage. An outer tertiary layer of conforming elastic tape is applied over the cotton. Finished
bandage should be firm with even compression over entire surface. Toes must be visible for monitoring.


SLINGS, CASTS, AND OTHER FORMS OF IMMOBILIZATION Velpeau sling. A, Conforming gauze bandage material is wrapped loosely around the paw, with direction of wrapping
causing the gauze to pass from medial to lateral on the dorsal surface of the paw, as shown. B, With carpus, elbow, and shoulder all flexed, gauze is brought from paw over lateral
aspect of limb and shoulder, over chest and back, and caudal to the opposite axilla. It then continues across the ventral chest, back to the starting point. C, Several more layers of
gauze are applied in a similar manner, and a few layers are brought around (cranial to) the flexed carpus to prevent extension of the elbow. Such extension could force the distal limb
out of the bandage. Wide elastic tape is used for covering the gauze in a pattern similar to that used for the gauze application which completes application of the splint.


Apply cotton, winding it around the leg from distal to proximal as far as possible into the axillary or inguinal space.
Each turn of the cotton should overlap the last layer by 50%.
Wrap the cotton as evenly as possible.
Apply conforming gauze around the cotton as tightly as possible, working from distal to proximal.
Cotton should be evenly compressed until the bandage is firm to the touch.
Pull the tape stirrups proximally, and apply them onto the bandage. Their purpose is to prevent the bandage from slipping off the limb.
Cover with a tertiary layer of conforming tape.
Goal of this bandage is even compression and firm support over the entire limb.
Properly applied, the finished bandage should make a thumping sound like a ripe melon when it is percussed.
Tips of toes must be visible for monitoring. Owing to the high compression, this bandage can cause severe ischemic injury if applied poorly.


SPLINTS:


Apply tape stirrups as for the Robert Jones bandage.
Apply cast padding, starting distally and winding around the limb as far proximally as needed.
Apply a layer of conforming gauze from distal to proximal area.
Place rigid splint material, usually on the caudal or lateral side of the limb.
Repeat another one to two layers of conforming gauze.
Cover with an outer layer of conforming tape.


CASTS:


Apply adhesive tape stirrups.
Roll stockinette over the limb, allowing extra length proximally and distally. Stockinette is optional but does give the cast a more finished appearance.
Apply a light layer of cast padding over stockinette.
Apply roll gauze with light and even compression.
Apply casting tape over the gauze in distal-to-proximal direction, overlapping by 50% and avoiding digital pressure and wrinkles during application. Layer as needed for appropriate
strength.
Support the limb at multiple points while hardening to avoid dents or incorrect alignment.
Roll stockinette ends over the cast ends.
Apply the stirrups to the cast. Their purpose is to prevent the cast from slipping off the limb.
Cover with an outer tertiary layer of elastic conforming tape.


SLINGS:


Velpeau sling (forelimb):
Lightly pad the foot and carpus with cast padding to prevent excessive flexion.
Wrap conforming gauze around the foot from medial to lateral.
Hold the limb adducted against the body wall with the carpus, elbow, and shoulder in flexion.
Roll the conforming roll gauze around the limb and thorax, passing caudally to the opposite forelimb to prevent slipping.


SLINGS, CASTS, AND OTHER FORMS OF IMMOBILIZATION Ehmer sling. A, Adhesive tape is passed around the lightly padded metatarsal region, coming up the lateral
side of the metatarsus. B, Tape is twisted 180○, and stifle and tarsus are held in flexion. Adhesive side of tape is applied to medial side of stifle, continuing up and over thigh as

proximal into inguinal space as possible. C, Tape is again twisted 180○ to keep adhesive side against skin and is applied to medial side of hock, then around to starting point
on lateral side of metatarsals. Tape is continued for another 1-2 layers over same pattern for greater support. D, To support hip reduction, tape may be continued over the
back, with the hip in slight abduction. E, Tape is passed once around the body and stuck to itself as a belly band.
