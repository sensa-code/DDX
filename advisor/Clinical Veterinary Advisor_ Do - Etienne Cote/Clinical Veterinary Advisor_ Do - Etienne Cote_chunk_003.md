`�` Increased pressure in the abdomen leads to hypoperfusion and ischemia of abdominal organs and, when severe, direct compression of blood vessels.

This leads to alterations in renal (most recognized), hepatic, and gastrointestinal functions. Anuria can occur with IAP > 30 mm Hg. Liver function, including
cytochrome P450 function, is impaired. Intestinal edema can develop, as well as bacterial translocation through gastrointestinal walls.

`�` Reduced ability for the diaphragm to contract against the tense abdomen impairs tidal volume and compromises ventilation, resulting in hypoxia and
hypercapnia. Mechanical/positive pressure ventilation is similarly affected.

`�` Increase in central venous pressure (CVP) and drop in cardiac output (increased systemic vascular resistance, decreased venous return to the heart,
compression of vascular structures from increased intrathoracic pressure) result in altered cardiovascular function.

`�` Intracranial pressure elevations can occur because of elevated CVP.

`�` Hormonal changes occur in response to the altered cardiovascular state, including elevations in renin-angiotensin activity, antidiuretic hormone, and
catecholamine levels.

`�` Ischemia-reperfusion injury occurs after shock resuscitation and can affect distant organ function.

`�` Abdominal wall complications can occur secondary to hypoperfusion, including delayed or impaired wound healing, dehiscence, and surgical site infection.

`�` Recognition of increasing IAP and prevention of ACS are crucial to reducing morbidity and mortality.

`�` There is no single threshold IAP that will result in organ dysfunction or failure in all patients and can be used for decision making. The critical IAP in most
patients is between 10 and 15 mm Hg; at this pressure, initial organ dysfunction develops.


**DIAGNOSIS**


**DIAGNOSTIC OVERVIEW**


IAP must be measured to confirm the diagnosis of abdominal compartment syndrome.


**INITIAL DATABASE**


Most common method of measuring IAP is the intravesicular or “bladder” technique, which is an indirect measurement.


`�` A water manometer is attached to a stopcock in the evacuation line from a standard urinary (urethral) catheter.

`�` The urinary bladder is emptied, and a few milliliters of isotonic sterile saline are placed in the bladder (3-10 mL, depending on patient size).

`�` After 30-60 seconds (to allow the saline to warm and the detrusor muscle to relax, avoiding a falsely elevated reading), the zero mark on the manometer is

held at the level of the cardiac atria (level of the umbilicus in lateral recumbency).

`�` The manometer is filled with saline.

`�` The stopcock is then opened to the bladder.

`�` The reading (in mm Hg) is taken when the column of saline reaches a stable level.

`�` The measurement should be taken at end expiration.

`�` Abdominal muscle contractions can increase IAP readings. Obese patients may have a higher baseline IAP.

`�` Alternative measurement techniques include nasogastric balloon catheter (good for continuous measurement), direct intraabdominal catheter/abdominal
drain, and venous catheter in the caudal vena cava. These techniques give similar information but can be more cumbersome to place and maintain.

`�` Trends in pressure parameters may be more important than any single number. It is important to use the same positioning each time a measurement is
taken.

`�` The IAP measured at one point in the abdominal cavity can be assumed to be the pressure throughout the abdominal cavity.

`�` Imaging can be helpful for looking for underlying causes of IAH but is insensitive at detecting increased IAP.


**ADVANCED OR CONFIRMATORY TESTING**


`�` Repeated IAP measurements are essential for monitoring.

`�` Lactate levels, liver enzyme changes, urine output, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels to identify abdominal organ dysfunction associated with ACS

`�` Measurements of cardiac output and other cardiovascular parameters and monitoring mentation and intracranial pressure give a more extensive
assessment of cardiovascular function and perfusion.

`�` Abdominal perfusion pressure (APP; mean arterial pressure minus IAP) has been proposed as a more accurate predictor of visceral perfusion. It assesses

the severity of IAP, as well as the adequacy of abdominal blood flow, and should be maintained at 50-60 mm Hg in patients with IAH/ACS.


**TREATMENT**


**TREATMENT OVERVIEW**


Medical management is crucial to prevention and treatment of IAH. Surgical decompression is the definitive treatment if medical management fails to prevent
further increases in IAP and organ dysfunction and failure.


**ACUTE, GENERAL TREATMENT**


`�` IAP of 10-20 mm Hg is a mild elevation and should be monitored.

`�` IAP of 20-35 mm Hg is a moderate to severe elevation.

`�` Consider active (centesis or surgical) decompression if pressure continues to rise or if other parameters continue to deteriorate.

`�` IAP > 35 mm Hg is a severe elevation.

Abdominal Compartment Syndrome Página 3 de 3


`�` ACS is extremely likely.

`�` Abdominal decompression is required.

`�` If a correctible source is not identified, surgical exploratory laparotomy is indicated.

`�` Medical Management

`�` Sedation, analgesia, and/or neuromuscular blockade to reduce muscle tone secondary to pain, agitation, and ventilator dyssynchrony, which result
in increased IAP

`�` Not effective at treating severe IAH/ACS

`�` Nasogastric or colonic decompression can reduce IAP and treat mild/moderate IAH.

`�` Prokinetic motility agents useful in decreasing visceral volume

`�` Aim for euvolemia.

`�` Hypervolemia can lead to ACS development.

`�` Hypertonic crystalloid and colloid resuscitation shown to reduce IAP and decrease risk of ACS

`�` Diuretics to mobilize third space fluid accumulation

`�` Percutaneous decompression to remove free abdominal fluid or air

`�` If this fails to resolve IAH, patient must undergo surgical decompression.

`�` Surgical Management (VERY rare in companion animals, barring arterial hemorrhage)

`�` Direct removal of the fluid or tissue causing the problem

`�` Performed when organ dysfunction/failure and IAH are refractory to medical management

`�` Open abdomen or temporary abdominal closure techniques often employed in human medicine


**CHRONIC TREATMENT**


`�` Placement of abdominal drains or repeated drainages/centeses in chronic conditions to maintain reduced pressure may be necessary. Treatment of the
underlying disease is essential.


**DRUG INTERACTIONS**


Hepatic and renal elimination of drugs may be altered by ACS, requiring dosage adjustment or alternative drug choices.


**RECOMMENDED MONITORING**


IAP, CVP, blood pressure, blood chemistry, lactate, urine output, diagnostic imaging as indicated by underlying cause and progression of IAP over time


**PROGNOSIS AND OUTCOME**


Prognosis depends on underlying cause and associated abnormalities, organ dysfunction, and disease. In human medicine, ACS is a significant cause of
morbidity and mortality (approaching 70%). Disregard for elevated IAP and delay of surgery are associated with further increases in patient mortality.


**PEARLS & CONSIDERATIONS**


**COMMENTS**


`�` Most critically ill patients should have urethral catheters in place to monitor urine output, which allows for IAP monitoring and early detection of ACS.

`�` IAH may falsely elevate indirect intracardiac pressure readings due to abdominothoracic transmission of pressure.

`�` Monitoring and management of patients this ill requires 24-hour care.


**TECHNICIAN TIP**


IAP is most easily measured in recumbent patients. If the patient is conscious and mobile, care must be taken to prevent the patient from chewing the catheter
and retaining the proximal portion in the abdomen or bladder (Elizabethan collar essential).


**PREVENTION**


Avoid excessive fluid volume resuscitation. Careful monitoring essential, with early preventive action taken if IAP rises.

Abdominal Distention Página 1 de 6


**Abdominal Distention**


**BASIC INFORMATION**


**DEFINITION**


Enlargement of the abdominal cavity


**EPIDEMIOLOGY**


**SPECIES, AGE, SEX** : Dependent on underlying cause


**CLINICAL PRESENTATION**


**HISTORY, CHIEF COMPLAINT**


`�` Abdominal enlargement (rate of distention is extremely variable, varies from acute to chronic and insidious)

`�` Perceived weight gain

`�` Decreased activity

`�` Anorexia

`�` Tachypnea

`�` Abdominal discomfort/pain

`�` When ascites is present and the fluid accumulation is rapid, clinical signs of weakness and dyspnea are more likely to be apparent.

`�` History may include clinical signs associated with the primary disease (e.g., repeated, unproductive attempts at vomiting if gastric dilatation and volvulus;
dyspnea, cough if cardiac disease; icterus if liver disease).


**PHYSICAL EXAM FINDINGS**


`�` Visible abdominal enlargement

`�` Abdominal palpation:

`�` Fluid wave may be present (ballottement) with ascites.

`�` An abdominal mass or organomegaly (liver, spleen, kidney, etc.) may be palpable.

`�` Physical abnormalities associated with primary disease may be present:

`�` Cardiovascular abnormalities (heart murmur, arrhythmia, gallop sound, jugular distention) should warrant further investigation into the possibility of
right heart failure.

`�` Marked generalized lymphadenopathy may suggest lymphoma.

`�` Muffled heart sounds are consistent with pericardial effusion and tamponade if ascites is present.


**ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY**


`�` Ascites: all causes

`�` Hyperadrenocorticism/Cushing's disease

`�` Cyst (renal, hepatic)

`�` Gastrointestinal dilation (food, air, water, foreign material)

`�` Lipoma

`�` Lymphadenopathy

`�` Mass, non-neoplastic (hematoma, granuloma, abscess)

**TREATMENT**


**TREATMENT OVERVIEW**


Treatment of underlying disease and therapeutic abdominal drainage if large-volume ascites is causing the abdominal compartment syndrome (see p. 4)


**ACUTE GENERAL TREATMENT**


`�` Treatment of underlying disease:

`�` Chemotherapy if lymphoma

`�` Pericardiocentesis if pericardial effusion is present

`�` Drug therapy for congestive heart failure

`�` Removal of fluid if discomfort or respiratory difficulty is present (see p. 1192 ).

`�` Surgery may be indicated for neoplasia, pyometra, peritonitis, and some causes of hemorrhage (e.g., ruptured splenic or hepatic hemangiosarcoma).


**PROGNOSIS AND OUTCOME**


Dependent on underlying cause


**PEARLS & CONSIDERATIONS**


**COMMENTS**


`�` Approach to patient with abdominal distention is to determine the nature of the primary problem.

`�` Thoracic radiographs should be part of the routine evaluation for a patient with ascites so as not to overlook the possibility of cardiac, pericardial, or
metastatic disease–or pleural effusion.

`�` The cause of abdominal distention may be benign (obesity, intraabdominal lipoma, cyst).
