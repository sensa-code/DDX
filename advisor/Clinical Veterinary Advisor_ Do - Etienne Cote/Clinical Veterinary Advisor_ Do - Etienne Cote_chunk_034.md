CHEST TUBE PLACEMENT A, For placement of a chest tube, animal is in lateral recumbency, and an incision is made in
the skin at least two intercostal spaces (ICS) caudal to planned site of entry into thorax. B, Chest tube and trocar within it are
tunneled together SQ to the appropriate ICS, and chest is entered with the tube. C, Tube is then advanced off the trocar
(small arrows) such that all side holes of the chest tube are within the pleural space, and trocar has not advanced farther into
chest. Trocar is then withdrawn (larger arrow), and chest tube is capped and secured.

photo. Right-handed clinician is using left hand to identify the occipital protuberance (index finger) and wings of the
atlas (right wing of atlas: thumb; left wing of atlas: middle and ring fingers). Patient's neck is appropriately flexed (90°),
and nose is elevated by an assistant so muzzle is parallel to table surface.

1 Indicates that the drug can be administered intratracheally using a long catheter, generally at double the dose and followed by several deep breaths.


POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS AND COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID


Inaccurate drug dosage administration
Hyperventilation
Inadequate fluid resuscitation
Incorrect assessment of ECG, especially false interpretation of bad contact between ECG machine and animal as “ventricular fibrillation”
Inadequately trained personnel
Delayed defibrillation. The success of defibrillation in an experimental setting approaches 100% when instituted within 1 minute of onset of fibrillation and falls precipitously to virtually 0%
after 10-15 minutes.
Inadequate/infrequent monitoring of electrolytes, blood glucose, and physiologic parameters
Malfunctioning or unavailable equipment
Delayed decision to perform open-chest CPR in a patient for which it is appropriate
Acute renal failure, diarrhea, liver dysfunction, and altered mentation and reflexes are common sequelae to inadequate oxygen delivery and tissue perfusion. Organ function must be closely
monitored to take preemptive action should parameters deteriorate.


Prognosis overall is guarded to grave depending on the underlying disease process, age, and overall state of debilitation of the animal. The number of successful resuscitations (i.e., survive to
discharge) may approach approximately 4% in dogs and possibly greater than 4% in cats; however, the fact that they occur with good critical care management means that every effort should be
made to resuscitate animals when appropriate.


PROCEDURE


Most of the initial tasks listed here should be occurring simultaneously:


Identify lack of effective spontaneous circulation and ventilation.
Initiate chest compressions at 80-100 compressions/minute, compressing approximately 30% of chest diameter, with a 1:1 ratio of compression to relaxation. Hands should be placed over the
widest part of the chest for patients > 10 kg. Hands should be placed over the heart for patients < 10 kg. Interruption of chest compressions should be minimized to <10 seconds until ROSC
occurs.
Intubate the airway, and place ECG leads on limbs.
Begin assisted ventilation with 100% inspired oxygen at 10-12 breaths/minute, higher if pulmonary disease preventing effective oxygen transfer exists, or the patient was already hypoxemic.
Identify cardiac rhythm if any.
Establish vascular access (IV catheter) if not already established.
If anesthetized, turnoff inhalant anesthetics, and reverse any injectable drugs that have reversal agents.

Cardiopulmonary Cerebral Resuscitation http://www.clinicalvetadvisor2.com/html/bc/ch003s001_s003_s001.php...


If thoracic compromise exists (e.g., pleural effusion, pneumothorax) or arrest is due to pericardial effusion, open-chest CPR must be instituted immediately. With pericardial effusion, open the
pericardium ventral to the phrenic nerve to improve diastolic function of the heart and remove effusion.
Fluid administration: IV (or intraosseous [IO], especially in pediatric animals). Shock rate administration (90 mL/kg in dogs, 45 mL/kg in cats, with constant monitoring and adjustments as
needed) is appropriate if the patient was hypovolemic prior to the CPA. Otherwise, consider an initial bolus of 20 mL/kg in dogs, 10 mL/kg in cats if the patient was euvolemic; use caution
with cardiac or renal disease. Hypertonic saline can also be considered (4-6 mL/kg of 3% saline IV slowly over 5 minutes).
Administer epinephrine (low dose: 0.02 mg/kg IV; high dose: 0.2 mg/kg IV). Consider starting with the low dose, repeat with high dose if initial dose is unsuccessful.
Vasopressin (0.2-0.8 U/kg IV) can be considered instead of or in combination with epinephrine.
Defibrillate electrically (e.g., starting with 2-5 J/kg if closed chest, 0.2-0.5 J/kg if open chest) if ventricular defibrillation is present. Repeat defibrillation if ventricular fibrillation persists.
Additional medications to consider to treat arrhythmias: atropine (0.04 mg/kg IV) followed by epinephrine again if asystole unresponsive to initial epinephrine; amiodarone (5 mg/kg IV or IO
over 10 minutes) for refractory ventricular fibrillation, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), ventricular tachycardia (VT); lidocaine (2-3 mg/kg IV in dogs) for ventricular
tachycardia or flutter; atropine for persistent bradycardia; magnesium (0.15-0.3 mEq/kg IV slowly over 10 minutes) for refractory ventricular arrhythmias.
Start vasopressors (e.g., dopamine 2-10 mcg/kg/min IV) if BP not adequate once appropriate fluid resuscitation is administered.
Assess metabolic condition with repeated blood gas analysis and electrolyte and blood glucose monitoring: treat abnormalities accordingly.
Use ETco2 and Doppler transducer on the cornea to assess efficacy of CPCR attempts.
Monitor body temperature, cranial nerve reflexes.


POSTPROCEDURE


MONITOR, MONITOR, MONITOR: ideally continuously; otherwise very frequent intermittent monitoring is required. A majority of critically ill animals that have been resuscitated will arrest again
within a few hours. Clinicians should monitor the following:


BP
Ventilation
Oxygenation
Cranial nerve reflexes
Mentation
Blood gases
Organ-specific chemistries
Urine output
Electrolytes
Blood glucose
Central venous pressure
Lactate
Packed cell volume (PCV)
Coagulation deficits
Body temperature


Clinicians should also consider the following during the monitoring period:


Administration of mannitol at 1-2 g/kg IV over 30 minutes is useful to reduce cerebral edema secondary to hypoxic brain injury, as well as to support renal perfusion and improve circulation to
tissues.
Until the animal is conscious and mobile, recumbent animal care protocols must be used. Frequently turning the animal, lubricating its eyes, keeping it clean of eliminations, and keeping the
oropharynx clean and/or suctioning the endotracheal tube are imperative. Monitor for pressure-induced sores and blood flow impairment.
If postarrest recumbency lasts hours or more, passive range-of-motion exercises may help with improving ultimate recovery as well as helping assess the progress of the animal's muscle
strength.


ALTERNATIVES AND THEIR RELATIVE MERITS


There are many approaches to and controversies associated with CPCR. Many books and/or articles list different drug dosages and indications or contraindications. The reader is advised to be
prepared by reading multiple sources and generating a customized flow chart that takes into consideration the personnel, drugs, and equipment available at a particular practice. If the animal is
stable to move, post-resuscitation management should ideally be handled in a well-staffed 24-hour facility.
