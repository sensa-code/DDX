##### **Preface**

_“Not what we have, but what we enjoy, constitutes our abundance.”_
**-J Petit-Senn**


A second edition is both an opportunity and an enigma. It is an opportunity to improve on the original, to make it
bigger, more insightful, clearer—simply better. Coming on the heels of a first edition that was very well received,
it is a pleasure for us to aim higher. But if the original was a success, the revision is also an enigma, or even a
hazard: how do we make a book that keeps the best of the old while adding the most of the new?


**The** _**Clinical Veterinary Advisor: Dogs and Cats,**_ **second edition, has aimed from the very beginning to**
**find the best possible balance in this regard.** The basic structure and content of the book should be
recognizable to all readers of the first edition. Nevertheless, there are many innovations to be found here. There
are all-encompassing changes within the repeating template structure of chapters, and there are also dozens of
individual new chapters. Individual overview statements in 800 of the chapters now help guide the readerpractitioner toward implementing recommendations in a practical fashion. A great deal of new information for
clients and for technicians is now available. Every chapter that was included in the first edition appears again in
the second edition fully revised and updated; some have changed names to remain current (hemobartonellosis
now appears as hemotropic mycoplasmosis, hepatocutaneous syndrome is now superficial necrolytic dermatitis,
and so on), but users of the first edition can be assured that they will find up-to-date versions of all chapters in
this edition. This has indeed been the greatest challenge: keeping the very best, trimming or condensing
obsolete or duplicated facts, and introducing worthwhile new material. Doing so has required a herculean effort
from authors and editors. George Bernard Shaw faced the same issue when he finished a letter of
recommendation for a friend. In a note pinned to the letter, Shaw wrote, “Sorry the letter is so long. I didn't have
time to write you a short one.” Similarly, the _Advisor's_ authors and section editors had ample material at their
disposal, but unlike Shaw, they seem to have spared no effort in distilling the most valuable essentials out of it.
Their efforts translate into chapters that are focused, user-friendly, and up to date. Like the unreachable horizon,
the permanent goal for which the _Advisor_ will continue to strive is for its users to read each paragraph on every
page and think “This is exactly what I wanted to know.”


A new edition is justified when there has been substantial change, and updates need to be introduced. These
improvements should be evident to all readers through both changes in existing chapters, and the introduction of
new chapters. **Over 60 new topics have been created and added to this new edition.** They are summaries of
a wide range of disorders such as the MDR-1 (ABCB1) mutation, Xylitol toxicosis, Adulterated diets, Fear due to
veterinary visits, Canine influenza, and dozens of others. The novelty of these topics is matched by their clinical
relevance, and the appearance of these new chapters is a testament to their importance in veterinary practice.
They are presented in the same chronological template format that reflects the way the patient is received and
treated: Background information, then chief complaint and history, then physical exam, then analysis (etiology,
pathophysiology, differential diagnosis), diagnosis, treatment, and outcome. Every topic has one or more current
Suggested Reading sources for additional information, and these have, as much as possible, been drawn from
easily accessible journals and textbooks. There are many, many new photographs and illustrations, to convey
information graphically for those of us who are visual learners. The photographs in the printed version of the
book are also available in color in the online edition of the book.


**Over a dozen new Procedures and Techniques have been added, bringing the number of procedure**
**descriptions to over 100.** These additions range from the immediately practical (Porcupine quill removal,
Breeding soundness exam, Nebulization/coupage/respiratory therapeutics) to the referral-level (Tracheal stent
placement, Ethanol ablation of parathyroid nodules, Brain biopsy [stereotactic]). As before, these procedures are
described in a step-wise, template-based format, and their inclusion is as much for clinicians involved in actually
performing them as for attending veterinarians who plan to refer the patient and simply want to understand what
is involved in the procedure.


**An important set of specific improvements applied** _**en masse**_ **to all Section I (Diseases & Disorders)**
**chapters is the addition of clinical guidance statements.** Chapters now have two new subsections within
their Diagnosis and Treatment sections, called Diagnostic Overview and Treatment Overview, respectively.
Briefly, the format of chapters in the first edition allowed for diagnostic tests to be presented in an orderly and
clear manner. However, there was a risk of the “laundry list effect”: just because all relevant tests were stated


did not mean that the reader would know how to apply them, or which tests to use when. The information might
be encyclopedic, but veterinary practice runs more along the lines of a narrative. In this new edition, authors
covering every disease and disorder were tasked with adding a Diagnostic Overview statement to provide basic
clinical guidance for achieving a reasonable diagnosis of the disorder in question. The result is a positive and
deeply rewarding one. These overview statements now provide the insight of authors not only on what can be
done but realistically what should be done to achieve a basic working diagnosis. A typical Diagnostic Overview
statement for parvoviral enteritis of dogs, for example, states: “The diagnosis is suspected based on the
presence of anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, or a combination of these, typically in a young and usually
unvaccinated dog; confirmation requires fecal assay such as a parvovirus ELISA snap test.” It need not be
complicated, and is not meant to address every conceivable variation of the disease. Rather, these overviews
are a starting point for outlining a reasonable course of action. They offer a summary of expertise, “from the
trenches,” of what should be considered when working up a typical patient suspected of having a particular
disorder. Similarly, Treatment Overviews aim to address the unspoken questions that come up when looking at
a list of possible medications or interventions: which treatments should be applied? In which cases? Overall,
these changes are meant to improve what the book has to offer: not just facts, but insights into application of the
information provided.


The “health care team” approach is far from an abstract concept. For many of us, our animal health technician
colleagues spend as much time with our patients, if not more. To that end, **the** _**Advisor**_ **now contains**
**hundreds of Technician Tips** that were not available previously. The breadth of this information ranges from
nursing care to client counseling, from technical skills required when caring for patients with a certain disorder,
to common pitfalls to avoid. The overlap between what a veterinarian needs to know and what a technician
needs to know is substantial, and this new chapter section recognizes this important interaction.


Perhaps one of the most innovative changes for this edition relates to client education sheets. These templatebased, layperson's vocabulary-based summaries have been highly successful, with many, many positive
comments and widespread use. While it was tempting to expand the collection by summarizing more diseases
for clients to understand, it was apparent that there was an even greater need in client education: the
importance of clients’ grasping not just disease processes, but the actual instructions we give them when they
go home. These are the monitoring and treatment activities that we instruct owners to carry out as a followthrough on our care. Sources for information of this type are very few. Client education sheets from most
veterinary textbooks are dedicated to informing, but not necessarily empowering, the client; they discuss the
entire disease, from mechanism to outcome, rather than concentrating on what we expect the client to be
actively doing. Public sources of information, such as dog care manuals or healthy cat books, are useful, but the
extent of home medical care they describe is often very limited: how to trim the nails or how to give a tablet may
be covered, but how to provide elevated feedings for a patient with esophageal disease usually is not. Niche
sources such as websites or specialty books offer an individual approach for specific disorders but not a whole
series of “How to” summaries for home care. This is what is missing: information that helps clients carry out the
ancillary medical tasks we ask them to do at home after we discharge the patient.


**To address this information gap, the** _**Advisor**_ **now contains a compilation of 50 original medical “How-**
**to” client education sheets.** These new information documents cover a wide range of common home
management situations, including how to perform range-of-motion exercises on a patient with orthopedic or
neurologic disease, how to adapt the home environment for a pet that has become blind or deaf, how to deal
with incessant coughing, how to manage a dog or cat that is having a seizure, and how to feed a dog or cat that
has an indwelling (PEG or other) feeding tube. The range of topics reaches from the simple (how to remove the
scent from a dog or cat that has been sprayed by a skunk) through the mid-range (how to check a bandage or
cast for tightness) to the more complex (how to assist appropriately during caesarian section). In many cases,
one How-to client education sheet can apply to several diseases and disorders; How to monitor respirations and
How to construct and use an Elizabethan collar are such examples. The goal of all of these sheets is to provide
a reference that owners can consult when we have asked them to do something specific to help their
companion. Variations and modifications to suit individual patients are inevitable, and these information sheets
are written to provide a general summary that practitioners can use as a base for this type of information.


**Finally, one of the dominant features of the** _**Advisor**_ **is the solid link between the print and electronic**
**editions of the book.** Since it is only possible to obtain both together (neither website access nor the print book
is sold individually), the universal access of the web book and the hands-on gratification of opening the print
book are literally bound together. This interchange has allowed for some of the less widely used material, or
some chapters that overlap substantially with other chapters, to be updated and published only in the web


version of the book for this edition. As a result, the paper book remains portable, and the web book is
comprehensive. Over time, the growth of information together with the limitations of a single volume book meant
to be portable, means that we may rely on the web book as the vault of information and the paper book as the
wallet. It is my hope that this approach will bring about the best of both worlds: new information is introduced
without expanding the physical size of the paper book, and all the information can be found, whether one has
the paper book handy or not, anywhere at any time online. Even those of us who consider ourselves bookworms
will recognize the value of having online availability if we have worked relief shifts at other hospitals where the
textbook selection is poor, or have found ourselves in an emergency setting searching for information on an
uncommon topic in the middle of the night. Ultimately, this balanced approach is meant to be the answer to the
riddle “How do we grow without getting bigger?”
