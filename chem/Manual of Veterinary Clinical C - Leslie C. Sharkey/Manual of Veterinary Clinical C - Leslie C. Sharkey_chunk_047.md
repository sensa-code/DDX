Hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcemia: The hyperphosphatemia is most likely the result of
decreased glomerular filtration rate, whether due to renal or pre-renal factors. Calcium
changes unpredictably in small animal patients with renal failure, and total calcium may be


high, low or normal. In older patients, hypercalcemia of malignancy must also be considered
due to its high frequency. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is often associated with increases in
parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP), which can be measured. Most often, the
patient is evaluated for lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, and mass lesions in an attempt to
diagnose malignant neoplasia. In this case, the combination of non-regenerative anemia,
hypercalcemia, and hyperglobulinemia prompted evaluation of the marrow for the presence
of lymphoid malignancy.


Hyperproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia and hyperglobulinemia: In patients with
evidence of inflammatory or infectious disease, hyperglobulinemia is most often polyclonal
and due to increased production of acute phase reactants or immunoglobulins. In these
cases, albumin may be low because of downregulation of production in the liver since
albumin is a negative acute phase reactant. Very rarely, infectious diseases such as feline
infectious peritonitis, Leishmania, or tick borne diseases may cause a monoclonal
gammopathy, which must be distinguished from monoclonal gammopathies produced by
neoplastic lymphocytes. In this case, hypoalbuminemia could be exacerbated by losses into
the uterus.


Mild acidemia (decreased HCO3) with increased anion gap: These changes may be related
to uremic acidosis. Poor tissue perfusion associated with sepsis could create lactic acidosis as
well. Abnormally low albumin (an anionic protein) and high immunoglobulins (cationic
proteins) generally lower the anion gap.


Hyperamylasemia: The most likely cause for this change is the decreased glomerular
filtration rate, supported by the azotemia and hyperphosphatemia. Clinical signs are vague,
and pancreatic disease cannot be completely ruled out.


Bone marrow evaluation: Erythroid hypoplasia and myeloid hyperplasia are evident on the
marrow aspirate and are compatible with the interpretation of the CBC above. The small
numbers of mature plasma cells and lymphocytes are considered normal and there is no
evidence of lymphoid malignancy on the smears.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Popcorn was treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics and had an ovariohysterectomy. A
serum protein electrophoresis confirmed the presence of a polyclonal gammopathy. Repeat
CBC, serum biochemical profile, and urinalysis were normal eight weeks after surgery, and
urinary concentrating ability had recovered.


This combination of laboratory abnormalities suggested the possibility of several disease
processes. Hyperglobulinemia and hypercalcemia could be compatible with lymphoid
malignancy, and secondary hypercalcemic nephropathy could have explained the azotemia and
isosthenuria (See Case 4, Jag). Most of the laboratory abnormalities could have been
compatible with renal failure alone, especially if the renal failure was related to an inflammatory
process such as pyelonephritis (See Opie, Case 13). In this case, the clinical history and physical
examination were instrumental in prioritizing pyometra as a differential diagnosis. However,
because of the age of the patient, a more intensive evaluation for neoplasia (bone marrow
cytology and serum protein electrophoresis) was conducted prior to surgery because the owner
did not wish to pursue treatment for the pyometra if Popcorn also had neoplasia. As was noted
in other cases in which extra-renal disease influenced BUN, creatinine, or urine specific gravity
(Case 8: sepsis, Case 12: portosystemic shunt, Case 16: hyperthyroidism, Case 22: diabetes
mellitus, Case 23: hypoadrenocorticism), treatment Popcorn’s underlying disease was successful
in restoring urinary concentrating ability and BUN/serum creatinine values to normal.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: Although there were no parameters outside the reference intervals in the
leukogram, the increased fibrinogen indicates an acute phase response and inflammation. In
large animal species, fibrinogen is a more sensitive indicator of inflammation than changes in
the leukogram.


Erythrogram: The increased hemoglobin and MCHC are artifactual, since the body does not
produce hyperchromatic erythrocytes. Hemolysis, either in vitro or in vivo, can account for
these changes. Because the goat is not anemic, in vitro artifact is more likely than
intravascular hemolysis. In fact, the PCV is at the high end of the reference interval,
suggesting the potential for mild hemoconcentration.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Stress is the most likely reason for this hyperglycemia, although neither
corticosteroid effects (mature neutrophilia and lymphopenia) nor epinephrine effects (mature
neutrophilia, lymphocytosis) are evident in the leukogram. Both of these hormones elevate
serum glucose by inducing gluconeogenesis and/or interfering with insulin action. The
glucosuria reflects the fact that the renal tubular maximum for reabsorption of 100 mg/dl in
the goat has been exceeded (Belknap), but by itself does not justify a diagnosis of diabetes
mellitus, which is very rare in small ruminants. Renal tubular dysfunction can result in
glucosuria in the absence of hyperglycemia.


Azotemia: Azotemia should be categorized as pre-renal, renal, or post-renal. The physical
examination does not provide evidence for post-renal causes of azotemia (large distended or
firm bladder, accumulation of fluid in the abdomen). Renal azotemia appears likely given the
isosthenuric urine, however extra-renal causes of poor urinary concentrating ability should be
ruled out. Medullary washout could interfere with the kidney’s ability to optimally
concentrate urine (hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hypokalemia). The glucosuria could
contribute to osmotic diuresis. Poor liver function can be associated with polyuria/polydipsia
because of failure of urea production to generate a concentration gradient. Other
possibilities include psychogenic polydipsia as a component of hepatic encephalopathy,
increased central threshold of antidiuretic hormone release, and hypercortisolism from either
impaired hepatic degradation or stimulation of ACTH production by abnormal neurotransmitters. Evidence for impaired liver function in this case is weak, however hypoalbuminemia is
present and the increased AST could indicate hepatocellular damage. The concurrent
elevation in CK supports muscle damage as a source for the AST. The normal neurologic
examination argues against hepatic encephalopathy, although signs may be intermittent.


Pre-renal azotemia can exacerbate renal azotemia and pre-renal and renal azotemia often
occur together because of ongoing fluid loss via the poorly functioning kidneys.The highnormal PCV is compatible with hemoconcentration.


Clinical indicators of hydration status such as body weight and tacky mucous membranes
should be used to support evaluation of hydration status. Hyperproteinemia and hyperalbuminemia are good indicators of dehydration, but are less reliable when protein loss is part of
the disease process. Appropriate fluid therapy should reduce the pre-renal component of the
azotemia. Increasing tubular flow rates will decrease the amount of time for passive tubular
reabsorption of urea, so the BUN may fall to a proportionally greater degree than creatinine
with no change in total glomerular filtration rate.


Because of fewer non-renal influences, creatinine is preferred to BUN to assess renal function.
This is especially true in ruminants, because ruminal flora may recycle nitrogen, leading to a
slower increase in BUN with low glomerular filtration rate than in non-ruminant species.


Hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia: The most likely cause for hyperphosphatemia in any
azotemic patient is decreased urinary excretion of phosphorus. Reduced phosphorus
excretion in the saliva of anorexic ruminants also can result in hyperphosphatemia with any
illness associated with poor food intake. Mass law interactions in hyperphosphatemic patients
can cause hypocalcemia, and associated deficits of calcitriol can reduce intestinal calcium
absorption and increase skeletal resistance to parathyroid hormone. Hypoalbuminemia can
lower total serum calcium without affecting ionized calcium. Correction factors for hypoalbuminemia-induced hypocalcemia have not been developed for ruminants and the use of
formulas derived for dogs is probably not valid in small animals either. Specific information
on the reproductive status of this doe is not available, however dairy goats are susceptible to
periparturient hypocalcemia. In cases of periparturient hypocalcemia, magnesium may be
increased or decreased, but the serum phosphorus is usually low, making this an unlikely
diagnosis in Lucinda’s case (Rankins). Increased demand for calcium and phosphorus for
gestation and lactation combined with suppressed parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol production associated with inappropriate diet interferes with the ability to
mobilize the required minerals from skeletal reserves and contributes to poor intestinal
absorption. Grass tetany is another potential cause of hypocalcemia in ruminants.
Hypomagnesemia occurs in grass tetany and can lead to hypocalcemia secondary to a
blunted parathyroid hormone response. In Lucinda, magnesium levels are within the
reference interval, making this diagnosis unlikely at this time. Alkalosis, which is common in
sick ruminants, can predispose to hypocalcemia (Goff), however this patient is acidemic.


Hypoalbuminemia: Increased losses and decreased production can cause hypoalbuminemia.
Albumin is a negative acute phase reactant and given the high fibrinogen, hepatic
downregulation of production is likely. Other causes of decreased albumin production such
as poor liver function or starvation are not supported by other evidence in this case.


Increased losses of albumin are likely in Lucinda. With the azotemia and proteinuria, urinary
losses must be considered. The presence of a significant amount of blood suggests that the
proteinuria could be due to blood contamination or lower urinary tract disease. Clinically
significant glomerulonephritis is uncommon in goats (Smith) but is a possible source of
protein loss in this patient because it results in selective loss of albumin. Repeat measure of
urine protein on an atraumatically collected urine sample after any lower urinary tract disease
has been ruled out or treated could clarify the potential for glomerular protein loss; urinary
protein:creatinine ratio may be indicated.


Gastrointestinal losses are possible with her history of diarrhea, but losses generally include
both albumin and globulins. Normal serum globulin does not rule out intestinal loss,
especially if there may be increased production of globulins associated with an acute phase


response or immune stimulation. Gastrointestinal protein loss can be difficult to confirm or
quantitate, however measurement of fecal 1-proteinase inhibitor has been used as an
α
indicator of intestinal protein loss in people and dogs (Murphy). Gastrointestinal parasitism is
an important cause of hypoproteinemia and should be ruled out by examination of fecal
material and herd worming history. Other sources of loss less compatible with the clinical
history include dermal and third space losses.


Hypoalbuminemia due to a dilutional effect with overhydration can occur in association with
pregnancy, congestive heart failure, or other causes of fluid retention or overload. Physical
examination findings are not suggestive for any of these causes.


Hyponatremia with proportional hypochloremia: As described for albumin, relative water
excess can result in a dilutional effect on these electrolytes. This is not likely given the highnormal PCV. Hyperglycemia can exert an osmotic effect and result in hyponatremia and
hypochloremia by this mechanism, but is not of sufficient magnitude to be an issue in this
case. Dietary deficiency is rarely a cause but is possible. Increased loss is most likely and may
include mechanisms such as loss into milk with mastitis, sweating (more important for horses),
hypertonic fluid loss in the gastrointestinal tract or isotonic loss with replacement by free
water. Gastrointestinal stasis may predispose to sequestration of chloride.


Excessive loss via the kidney can also cause hyponatremia and hypochloremia. Given the
other evidence for renal disease, this is most likely. Inappropriate renal losses of electrolytes
in the context of low serum levels can be quantified by measuring urinary fractional
excretion. In this case, urinary fractional excretion of sodium and chloride should be low in
response to hyponatremia and hypochloremia. High or normal urinary excretion of these
electrolytes would indicate excessive urinary losses. These losses could also reflect hypoadrenocorticism because of failure of endocrine regulation of renal handling of electrolytes, but
this is rare in small ruminants and generally would be associated with hyperkalemia rather
than hypokalemia. ACTH stimulation test could be run to rule out this possibility.


Hypokalemia: Low intake of potassium is a more likely factor for this electrolyte than for
sodium and chloride. Clinically significant hypokalemia is more likely if combined with
increased losses. Mechanisms for increased loss are similar to those described for NaCl and
include losses through the gastrointestinal tract, into third spaces and through the kidney.
Polyuric renal failure is often associated with hypokalemia as increased tubular flow rates
decrease the time available for potassium reabsorption. Treatment with insulin for
hyperglycemia or with sodium bicarbonate for acid/base abnormalities can cause
translocation of potassium into cells and result in hypokalemia. It should be noted that serum
levels of sodium, chloride, and potassium do not generally reflect total body stores.
