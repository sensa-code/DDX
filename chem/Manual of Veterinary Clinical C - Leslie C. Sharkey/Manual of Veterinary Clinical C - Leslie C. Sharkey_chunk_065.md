Hyperkalemia: Polyuric renal failure is often associated with hypokalemia because of enhanced
urinary potassium loss. It is only when glomerular filtration is markedly limited or when urine
cannot be eliminated from the body that hyperkalemia ensues. Astra has marked dehydration
and clinical evidence of poor perfusion, including weak femoral pulses and prolonged capillary
refill time. This could severely reduce glomerular filtration rate. Her other laboratory
abnormalities also are suggestive for hypoadrenocorticism, which could lead to hyperkalemia
because of aldosterone deficiency. Cellular translocation in response to acidosis is also possible,
however this appears to be less important with organic acidosis than mineral acidosis.


Decreased anion gap: The low albumin and abnormal electrolyte values may decrease the
anion gap.


Increased AST: This most likely reflects tissue damage secondary to poor perfusion.


Increased amylase: The mild change in this value is most compatible with the decreased
glomerular filtration rate. Gastrointestinal disease also can be associated with increased
amylase and is compatible with the clinical history. Pancreatic disease cannot be ruled out,
but is not required to explain this data.


Urinalysis: The bactiuria indicates either contamination or a urinary tract infection.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Based on the suspicion of hypoadrenocorticism, an ACTH stimulation test was performed.
Both pre and post-stimulation values were <1.00 µg/dl, compatible with a diagnosis of
hypoadrenocorticism. A cardiology consult was not pursued based on normal auscultation
and thoracic radiographs. Astra was successfully treated with hormone supplementation and
antibiotics for the urinary tract infection.


These electrolyte abnormalities are classic for hypoadrenocorticism, however they are not
present in all cases of hypoadrenocorticism (Sadek). Therefore, any dog with a suggestive
history including weakness, lethargy, gastrointestinal signs, or collapse with hypovolemia
could potentially have hypoadrenocorticism. In some cases, the absence of any features of
the corticosteroid leukogram despite signs of severe illness may be a clue. Hyponatremia,
hypochloremia and hyperkalemia may also characterize other processes in addition to hypoadrenocorticim. These conditions include primary gastrointestinal disease (DiBartola), cavity
effusions (Chapter 7, Case 3) including uroabdomen (Chapter 5, Case 18), or renal failure
(Chapter 7, Case 9). Astra is a good example of extra-renal factors resulting in laboratory
data that could suggest primary renal disease. Astra is azotemic with relatively dilute urine,
hyperphosphatemia, hypermagnesemia, and hyperkalemia. All of these changes may result
from decreased glomerular filtration rate as was the case for Humphrey (Chapter 7, Case 9).
Low sodium and chloride could be attributable to primary renal dysfunction, in which case
urinary fractional excretions of these electrolytes would be high. Typically, appropriate fluid
therapy will correct electrolyte abnormalities and temporarily restore urinary concentrating
ability in patients with hypoadrenocorticism, while patients with renal failure will continue to
produce dilute urine.

Case 14 – Level 3
“Twix” is a 2-week-old Brown Swiss/Holstein mix calf presenting with a three day history of
diarrhea and lethargy. Originally, the diarrhea was yellow and runny, and she was treated with
antibiotics and electrolyte solutions. Over the past 2 days, the diarrhea became white and
watery. On physical examination, Twix had a good suckle reflex, though she was dull,
lethargic, and reluctant to stand. Ausculatation was normal, and she was mildly dehydrated.
Twix was not febrile or bloated. The diarrhea now has a dark brown mucoid, pudding-like
consistency. One other calf in the herd also may be affected. This farm has had documented
infections with _Cryptosporidium, Salmonella,_ and corona virus in the past.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Twix has a leukocytosis with increased band neutrophils, toxic change, and
monocytosis, indicating inflammation (Figure 7-4). The microcytosis may be due to age
associated differences in red blood cell size (Adams). Thrombocytosis is often associated with
inflammation in large animal species.

bovine blood film.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Stress is the most likely explanation for the hyperglycemia, however since
the transition to ruminal digestion does not occur in calves until 3 to 4 weeks of age, serum
glucose levels may be somewhat higher than in the adult.


Azotemia: Twix is mildly azotemic. Without a urine specific gravity, the azotemia is difficult to
classify, however the history and physical examination suggest pre-renal azotemia due to
dehydration.


Hypoproteinemia: Both albumin and globulin levels are within the reference intervals,
making the significance of the low total protein difficult to interpret. Neonatal animals often
have lower serum total protein values because of relatively greater total body water content
and naïve immune systems. The protein values may be elevated by dehydration, and should
be reassessed after fluid deficits are corrected.


Hypernatremia and hyperchloremia: In this case, isotonic or hypotonic fluid losses combined
with supplementation with hypertonic to isotonic fluids leads to relative water deficit and
accumulation of excessive electrolytes. Most patients that have access to water and have
adequate renal function will still be able to regulate serum electrolyte concentrations.
Unfortunately, Twix did not have access to water, but it is likely that she has normal renal
function and the mild azotemia is pre-renal.


Decreased bicarbonate (acidemia): Loss of bicarbonate containing fluids in the diarrhea is
the likely cause of the low bicarbonate.


Increased ALP: While an increase in the ALP could be compatible with hepatobiliary disease,
bone growth in young animals also will elevate this value and complicate interpretation.


Increased GGT: Elevation in serum GGT is a more specific indicator of liver disease in large
animal species than ALP, however it may also be influenced by age-related phenomena such


as peripartum elevations following colostrum ingestion. In addition, liver damage may occur
secondary to intestinal disease and/or hypoperfusion. The normal SDH suggests that
increases in ALP and GGT may be due to extra-hepatic causes such as bone growth and
colostrum ingestion, respectively. While less likely, it is possible that liver damage occurred
transiently in the past but is not ongoing and thus is no longer reflected by changes in SDH,
which has a very short serum half life and rapidly decreases after cessation of injury.


Increased AST and CK: These enzyme elevations suggest muscle damage, potentially related
to medical intervention or transport. The AST is less tissue-specific than the CK and could
also be related to hepatocellular damage.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Twix was treated with intravenous fluids containing bicarbonate until the acidosis resolved,
then she received oral milk replacer. Sodium and chloride supplementation was gradually
decreased until her electrolyte abnormalities were corrected. She was also treated with
antibiotics. Fecal samples were evaluated for _Salmonella,_ corona virus, rota virus, and
_Escherchia coli,_ and a non-hemolytic _E. coli_ was cultured. Twix responded well to therapy and
was released from the hospital.


Like Delaney (Chapter 7, Case 8), Twix likely experienced loss of hypotonic fluids, leading to
concentration of remaining electrolytes in a smaller volume of intravascular water. Generally,
this will stimulate thirst and water intake, so in both patients, restricted access to water may
have contributed to the electrolyte abnormalities. Loss of isotonic fluids can also result in
hypernatremia and hyperchloridemia if electrolytes are over-supplemented as was the case
for Twix. This is roughly the opposite process that occurred with Darla (Chapter 7, Case10),
where isotonic fluid loss associated with hemorrhage was replaced by increased intake of
water, diluting remaining electrolytes in the blood. These cases show that gains and losses of
both electrolytes and water must be considered when evaluating serum electrolyte data.

Case 15 – Level 3
“Jason” is a 3-year-old Staffordshire Terrier presenting with anorexia and lethargy after
consuming 1/3 of the Thanksgiving turkey carcass 2 weeks ago. He previously was diagnosed
with diabetes mellitus. Jason is being treated with insulin, but he has had worsening polyuria
and polydipsia despite increasing doses of insulin. Several weeks ago, hematuria was noted
and Jason was treated with antibiotics. Jason typically has an excellent appetite, but had
been eating less prior to the turkey episode. On presentation to the referring veterinary
practice 2 days ago, mineral opacities were seen on survey radiographs. A subsequent
abdominal exploratory merely revealed an area of ileus, which was evacuated with no
evidence of obstruction. At that time, the liver was enlarged and fatty in appearance. A
biopsy was taken, however no results are yet available. Two days after surgery, Jason was
referred to the teaching hospital because of declining status and inability to maintain
hydration despite fluid therapy. On presentation, Jason appears obtunded, dehydrated and
shocky. He has bilateral diabetic cataracts and a non-painful but doughy abdomen. He has
numerous decubital ulcers, with a large decubital ulcer over his left lateral hock.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Jason has a moderate neutrophilic leukocytosis with a mild regenerative left shift,
lymphopenia, and monocytosis. Corticosteroid effects could contribute to the increased
mature neutrophils, lymphopenia and monocytosis, while the regenerative left shift suggests
inflammation is also playing a role in the leukogram changes. Jason has a microcytic
hypochromic anemia, which suggests the potential for an iron deficiency anemia, especially in
combination with the thrombocytosis. A portosystemic shunt may be accompanied by
microcytosis but is unlikely with the other clinical and laboratory data. Some Japanese breeds
normally are microcytic (Akita or Shiba Inu).


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Although this level of blood glucose is compatible with other causes of
hyperglycemia such as stress, corticosteroid treatment, or pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus is
the most likely cause given Jason’s history.


Decreased BUN: The low BUN may be related to the polyuria/polydipsia and increased
tubular flow rates. A low protein diet could contribute. Decreased liver function is possible
given the microcytosis and hypoalbuminemia, however it is not specifically evaluated here.
The creatinine is at the lower limit of the reference interval and may reflect
polyuria/polydipsia or muscle wasting.


Hypocalcemia with normal phosphorus: The low serum albumin may account for some of
the hypocalcemia but will not impact ionized calcium. Laboratory error does occur, so the
test could be repeated to verify the abnormality. Other considerations in this case include
acute pancreatitis, which is possible with the history of dietary indiscretion. Primary
hypoparathyroidism or Vitamin D deficiency are possible, however they are rare and often
associated with hyperphosphatemia, which is not present here. Ionized calcium could be
measured to further clarify Jason’s calcium status.


Mild hypoalbuminemia: Decreased intake, decreased production or selective losses result in
hypoalbuminemia. Jason has been anorexic with muscle wasting, suggesting that poor
nutritional status could impair albumin production. There is some potential for decreased
liver function, however further testing is required to assess this possibility. Selective loss of
albumin through the glomerulus could be occurring, and a urinalysis or urine
protein:creatinine ratio should be performed to quantify proteinuria. It is important to
remember that urine protein may be elevated in association with occult urinary tract
infections, which are common in diabetic patients.


Hypernatremia with proportional hyperchloremia: These electrolyte abnormalities occur
when there is a disproportionate deficit of free water and may be associated with hypotonic
fluid losses (renal, gastrointestinal, third space, cutaneous). Restricted access to water alone,
or in concert with the hypotonic losses could also cause these elevations. In Jason’s case,
glucose in the urine causes osmotic diuresis and fluid loss. Gastrointestinal fluid losses are
also likely, while no mention is made of an effusion or significant skin disease. Jason’s
pressure sores suggest that he was unable to move adequately to drink water, and his access
to water may have been restricted associated with the enterotomy. Intravenous fluid therapy
appears to have been inadequate to maintain hydration, and replacement of hypotonic fluid
losses with isotonic fluids could exacerbate the electrolyte excesses.


Increased CK: The elevated CK may be related to muscle damage from inability to move and
the development of pressure sores. Other potential causes include iatrogenic manipulation
such as surgery and intramuscular injections.
