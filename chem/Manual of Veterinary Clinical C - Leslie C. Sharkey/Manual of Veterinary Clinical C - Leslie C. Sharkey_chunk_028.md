The combination of microcytosis and evidence of liver dysfunction (some combination of low
glucose, BUN, albumin, cholesterol, prolonged coagulation times) and mildly elevated liver
enzymes in a young dog should prompt consideration of a portosystemic shunt, particularly
in a high risk breed. Dylan’s case should be compared with other cases of portosystemic
shunts to observe variability in laboratory abnormalities that may occur with this condition.
Dylan and Pugsley (Chapter 5, Case 12) were microcytic, while YapYap (Chapter 3, Case 7)
and Binar (Chapter 2, Case 12, a cat) had normal MCV. While all of these cases were
characterized by hypoalbuminemia, only Dylan, YapYap, and Pugsley were hypoglycemic. All
except for YapYap had at least one elevated liver enzyme, but serum bilirubin was normal in
all cases. Only YapYap was hypocholesterolemic. BUN was low in all of the previous cases,
but Dylan’s BUN was within reference intervals.


Case 3 – Level 1
“Princess” is a 6-year-old intact female German Shepherd that was hit by a car. She presents in
lateral recumbancy with thready pulses. She has at least eight broken ribs and is extremely
painful. A quick PCV and total protein are within reference intervals at presentation. After fluid
therapy and medication for pain, samples are drawn for CBC and serum biochemical profile.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Princess has a moderate mature neutrophilic leukocytosis with lymphopenia and
monocytosis. Although inflammation is likely based on the degree of trauma, these findings
can be explained by corticosteroid effects alone. There is a normocytic, normochromic anemia
that does not appear to be regenerative at this time, however several days should be allowed
for the marrow to respond to an acute episode of blood loss. Serial reticulocytes counts would
resolve this issue. Thrombocytopenia may be attributable to consumption with hemorrhage.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia: Tissue trauma or necrosis is the most likely cause
for the increased serum phosphorus (leakage from cells), and is likely also causing some of
the increase in AST. The hypocalcemia is most likely related to the hypoalbuminemia. Other
differential diagnoses include renal disease (the patient is not currently azotemic) or
hypoparathyroidism, which is possible but further diagnostic testing should not be pursued
unless the abnormalities are persistent once the current presenting problem is resolved.


Panhypoproteinemia: Decreases in both albumin and globulins are evidence of non-selective
protein losses. Of the many potential sites of protein loss, Princess is most likely to be
hypoproteinemic secondary to hemorrhage associated with trauma. If the presentation is
extremely acute, patients with significant hemorrhage may initially have normal serum total
protein values because there has not been sufficient time for fluid shifts to occur that
compensate for the hypovolemia. Albumin is also a storage pool protein that may be
depleted if increased protein is required for tissue repair after trauma or surgery. With
extensive tissue damage or vascular compromise, protein may move from the circulation into
the interstitial space, further lowering serum albumin concentration.


Increased ALT and AST: Hepatocellular damage may be related to direct trauma of the liver,
however perfusion deficits associated with hemorrhage and shock may contribute. While the
increased ALT indicates that a significant amount of the increase in AST may be hepatic, this
history of trauma and shock is also likely to result in damage to muscle and other tissues
which may contain and release AST. A CK could be measured to assess the muscle
component.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Over the next few days, Princess began vomiting and developed hyperbilirubinemia and
elevations in ALP and GGT, which indicated cholestatic disease in addition to or as the result
of the initial hepatocellular damage (See Chapter 2 for further discussion of the relationship
of these two processes). A week after presentation, the ALT and AST were almost within
reference intervals, however the ALP and GGT remained elevated. At that time, schistocytes
were noted on the blood film. Microangiopathic hemolysis was suspected based on the
potential for severe tissue trauma and necrosis to result in activation of coagulation or even


disseminated intravascular coagulation. Breakdown of extravasated RBCs may have been
contributing to the hyperbilirubinemia. The coagulation panel was normal, however Princess
was treated with anticoagulants because of the potential for the development of thrombosis.
By 10 days after presentation, Princess appeared clinically improved and the bilirubin, ALP,
and GGT levels were declining. She was discharged and had an uneventful recovery at home.


Case 4 – Level 1
“Red Molly” is a 12-year-old spayed female Cairn Terrier presenting for weight loss and
flatulence. On presentation, Red Molly is well hydrated, with a mild sinus arrhythmia. The
abdomen feels slightly doughy, but is non-painful. There is a grade I/IV patellar luxation on
the right.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: No abnormalities


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypocalcemia with normal phosphorus: The hypocalcemia may be due to the hypoalbuminemia, although low ionized calcium has been described in dogs with malabsorptive
intestinal diseases due to the formation of calcium-fatty acid complexes in the intestinal
lumen or decreased absorption of Vitamin D (Kull).


Panhypoproteinemia: While both decreased production and increased losses may contribute
to low serum total protein, panhypoproteinemia is usually attributable to increased
nonselective loss of protein. Red Molly does not have any evidence of hemorrhage, severe
skin disease, or body cavity effusions, however she does present for gastrointestinal disease.
Liver dysfunction could compound increased losses of albumin, and could also account for
the hypocholesterolemia.


Hypocholesterolemia: This abnormalitiy is of limited clinical significance, but can be present
with severe protein losing enteropathy, decreased liver function, or malnutrition.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

To confirm gastrointestinal loss of protein, three fecal samples were submitted for measurement
of alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor. This is a protein that is generally not present in the gut of the
dog, but when present, it cannot be degraded by intestinal bacteria. Red Molly’s fecal alpha 1
proteinase activity levels were consistently high (mean 19.5 µg/g, reference interval 0-5.0),
supporting increased intestinal permeability. Unfortunately, this test does not differentiate
between the different types of intestinal lesions that can cause protein losing enteropathy.
Protein losing enteropathy may occur secondary to congenital or acquired pathology. Acquired
cases in dogs are often attributable to inflammation or neoplasia (German). Definitive diagnosis
requires invasive procedures such as endoscopy or laparotomy with collection of biopsy
samples for histologic examination (Melzer). Even with biopsy, inter-observer variation between
pathologists’ interpretations of biopsy samples can lead to confusion regarding diagnosis of
intestinal disease (Willard), and these patients are at risk for complications including delayed
healing due to low protein levels (Melzer). Red Molly’s owners elected to try dietary
management with hypoallergenic food prior to invasive procedures or medical therapy.


Red Molly is similar to the previous case (Princess), in that non-selective protein loss resulted
in decreases in both albumin and globulins. The clinical history provided critical information
about the likely sources of non-selective protein loss, which was supported somewhat by
other laboratory data (anemia compatible with hemorrhage in Princess and hypocholesterolemia in Red Molly).

plasma cell hyperplasia in a lymph
node from a dog.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Denver has thrombocytopenia and a mild normocytic normochromic nonregenerative
anemia. Because Denver is thrombocytopenic, hemorrhage is a possible cause for anemia
and the hypoproteinemia. This is less likely since, given sufficient time, blood loss anemias
are generally regenerative and there is no history of bleeding. Anemia of chronic disease is
likely, although the concurrent thrombocytopenia suggests the possibility of a bone marrow
disorder resulting in decreased production of erythrocytes and platelets. Peripheral
lymphadenopathy suggests the potential for hematopoietic neoplasia that may involve the
marrow, however the results of the lymph node aspirate are more suggestive for a reactive
process. Tick borne diseases may cause anemia, thrombocytopenia, and reactive lymphoid
hyperplasia, and this patient should be evaluated for these diseases. Tick borne disease may
cause thrombocytopenia either by suppressing production of platelets and/or increased
destruction associated with vasculitis or immune-mediated processes. Immune-mediated
thrombocytopenia (ITP) may be secondary to infectious disease, or it may be a primary
idiopathic process. ITP could be considered if the work-up for infectious disease is negative.
Peripheral consumption of platelets due to disseminated intravascular coagulation is unlikely
because the PT and APTT are essentially normal. The slight increase in APTT is not
considered clinically significant.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Mildly increased BUN with normal creatinine: Possible causes for disproportionately
increased BUN in this patient include pre-renal azotemia, early renal failure, high protein diet
or gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Denver is dehydrated, however he also has poorly
concentrated urine, which is compatible with a combination of pre-renal azotemia with
possible early renal failure. There does not appear to be any non-renal factors that would
interfere with urinary concentrating ability at this time (e.g. osmotic diuresis, medullary
washout, liver failure, etc.; see Chapter 5). Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypoproteinemia
could be compatible with gastrointestinal hemorrhage, so careful evaluation for melena,
hematochezia, and hematemesis is recommended.
