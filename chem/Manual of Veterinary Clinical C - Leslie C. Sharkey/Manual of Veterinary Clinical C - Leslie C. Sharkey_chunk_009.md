Case 15, includes erythrocytes

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: Stella has a mild neutrophilic leukocytosis. This could be compatible with stress
(although lymphopenia is not seen), or inflammation. There are no toxic changes in the
neutrophils nor a left shift, and fibrinogen is within reference range, suggesting that
inflammation is either very mild or acute. The hyperglobulinemia on the serum biochemical
profile supports inflammation.


Erythrogram: Stella has a severe anemia. In the equine, reticulocytes are not released into the
circulation during regenerative responses, so it is not generally possible to categorize anemias
as regenerative or nonregenerative based on a single CBC. The presence of Heinz bodies
provide a possible explanation for the source of the anemia, as they reflect oxidative damage
to the red blood cell. When Heinz bodies are observed in the blood of horses, the clinician
should consider ingestion of plants such as onions, _Brassica_ species, or wilted red maple leaves
_(Acer rubrum)_ or exposure to drugs such as phenothiazines or methylene blue. On further
questioning of the owners, it was discovered that Stella had access to red maple leaves.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Increased BUN: This is likely prerenal as the urine is adequately concentrated.


Hyperproteinemia with hyperglobulinemia: The increased globulins may reflect increases in
either immunoglobulins or acute phase reactants. Regardless, it suggests inflammation.
Albumin appears normal at this time, indicating that dehydration is not the primary
explanation for the hyperproteinemia, however concurrent losses of albumin cannot be ruled
out and may mask the effects of dehydration.


Hypochloremia with low normal sodium and low bicarbonate: The low chloride is disproportionate to the change in sodium and is occurring in combination with low bicarbonate, an
indicator of metabolic acidosis. Because chloride generally varies inversely with bicarbonate
(which is NOT the case here), the data support a mixed acid/base disorder. An arterial blood
gas is required for complete evaluation of the acid/base status of this patient.


Hyperbilirubinemia with increased indirect bilirubin: In contrast to small animal patients in
which fractionation of bilirubin does not often yield much diagnostic information, bilirubin
fractionation can be of use in the horse. Increases in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin in the
horse include hemolysis, liver failure, and anorexia. In this case, there is evidence that all
three could contribute to the hyperbilirubinemia. Increases in direct (conjugated) bilirubin in
the horse rarely make up greater than 25% of the total bilirubin, and suggest biliary
obstruction.


Increased GGT: Increases in this enzyme reflect hepatobiliary disease or cholestasis.
Increases are seen in periparturient mares and miniature breed horses with fatty liver
syndromes.


Increased AST (5x), LDH (7x) and CK (125% of normal): Increases in AST and LDH can
indicate liver or muscle damage. Because the CK is also elevated, but more modestly
increased than AST and LDH, liver damage is likely responsible for the majority of the
enzyme elevation, with a smaller effect of muscle damage. It should be remembered that
none of these enzymes are considered tests of liver function.


Hyperammonemia: This test does evaluate liver function, which appears to be impaired.


Hypertriglyceridemia: Hyperlipidemia is not common in the horse, but can occur in
miniature breed horses and ponies with fatty liver syndrome. In this disease, decreased
caloric intake causes mobilization of fat with accumulation of lipid in the plasma and liver.
Decreased liver function often results.


Urinalysis: The urine is no longer brown, and is adequately concentrated. A positive reaction
for blood may occur on urine test strips with the presence of either intact red blood cells,
free hemoglobin, or myoglobin. The strong positive reaction for blood combined with small
numbers of erythrocytes reported on the sediment exam suggests that hemoglobin or
myoglobin was responsible for this result unless significant lysis of erythrocytes occured in
vitro in the urine sample. Calcium carbonate crystals are a normal finding in equine urine,
especially if the diet includes alfalfa hay.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Red Maple leaf toxicity resulting in severe hemolytic anemia secondary to Heinz body
formation, hepatocellular damage and decreased liver function, hyperlipidemia, and possible
mixed acid/base abnormalities.


Stella received blood transfusions to help improve her tissue oxygenation. She responded to
Banamine [®] and butorphanol to control signs of colic. Because of the potential for
hemoglobin nephropathy, she was treated with fluids and diuretics. Because of her
neurologic signs and decreased liver function, Stella also received lactulose, vitamins B and
K, and oral dextrose. She also was encouraged to eat. Five days after admission, Stella’s
blood ammonia was normal, her liver enzymes were decreasing, and her hematocrit was
steady. She was discharged with instructions to limit the protein in her diet to 12% to control
signs of hepatic encephalopathy and to examine pastures carefully to prevent any further
access to wilted red maple leaves.


Stella’s laboratory abnormalities reflect the complexity of her multiple medical problems. Like
Rocky (Case 13), hypoxia secondary to an acute hemolytic event may have damaged
hepatocytes, which were further impaired by the fatty liver syndrome. It is not possible to
determine if anorexia secondary to the hemolytic event precipitated the hyperlipidemia, or if
it was a pre-existing, smoldering condition secondary to foaling complications. Concurrent
muscle and liver hypoxia contributed to elevated enzyme levels in the blood. Muscle damage
similarly can complicate interpretation of increased liver enzymes in small animal patients (see
Bandit, Case 2). As noted above, Stella had all three common causes of increased indirect
bilirubin, and the relative contributions of each cannot be determined. The acid/base
abnormalities are incompletely characterized, however acidosis secondary to tissue hypoxia
with the metabolic acidosis that characterizes fatty liver may be combined with respiratory
alkalosis secondary to the tachypnea.


Liver Case 16 – Level 2
“Skipper” is a 15-year-old mare with a several week history of elevated liver enzymes and
bilirubin associated with jaundice, intermittent fevers, and decreased appetite. She has lost
weight and has some muscle loss through her haunches and withers. She has multiple
abrasions to her right fetlock and pastern which have been oozing blood–tinged fluid for the
past week. Her vital signs are normal, but her sclera and gums are yellow. She is moderately
depressed, but is alert and interested in her environment when stimulated.

Coagulation Profile
PT: 11.1s (10.9-14.5)
APTT: 56.6s (54.7-69.9)


###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Increased Fibrinogen: High fibrinogen levels suggest inflammation, which in this case is
corroborated by hyperglobulinemia on the serum biochemical profile. While there are no
changes in the leukogram at this time, fibrinogen in large animal patients is a more sensitive
indicator of inflammation than the leukogram.


Thrombocytopenia: Thrombocytopenia is associated with liver disease. The cause is often
thought to be consumptive, and related to endothelial damage within a highly vascular
organ. Another proposed mechanism is generalized immune activation that can be seen
when Kupffer cell function is impaired and the body is subjected to higher than normal levels
of toxins and bacteria from the improperly filtered portal circulation.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperproteinemia with hyperglobulinemia: The increased globulins may reflect increases in
either immunoglobulins or acute phase reactants. Regardless, it suggests inflammation.
Albumin appears normal at this time, indicating that dehydration is not the primary explanation
for the hyperproteinemia, however concurrent losses or decreased production of albumin
cannot be ruled out and may mask the effects of dehydration. In this case, because there is
evidence of liver disease, decreased hepatic production of albumin is a possibility as well.


Hyperbilirubinemia with increased direct and indirect bilirubin: Increases in indirect
(unconjugated) bilirubin in the horse include hemolysis, liver failure, and anorexia. Because
the hematocrit is within reference ranges, hemolysis is an unlikely contributor, but both
anorexia and liver disease are likely. Increased direct bilirubin is also present, suggesting
some degree of cholestasis.


Increased ALP (8x) and GGT (47x): Increases in these enzymes reflect hepatobiliary disease
or cholestasis.


Increased SDH: Increased SDH supports a diagnosis of hepatocellular disease.


Coagulation profile: Clotting times are normal at this time. Decreased liver function must be
severe to cause impaired production of coagulation factors, but animals with liver disease
may have prolonged clotting times because the liver also produces plasmin activators and
inhibitors and the liver is responsible for clearance of activated coagulation factors,
fibrinolytic enzymes, and the breakdown products of coagulation.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Cholestatic liver disease with mild inflammation


Hepatic ultrasound was performed to help guide liver biopsy collection once the normal
coagulation test results were received. On ultrasound, the liver was diffusely inhomogeneous,
but there was no evidence of biliary obstruction. Liver biopsy specimens revealed mild to
moderate bridging fibrosis, bile duct proliferation, and mild nodular hyperplasia. This was
thought to be suggestive of some form of chronic toxic hepatitis, however a specific cause
was never determined. There was a suggestion that the ulcerated lesions on Skipper’s fetlock
and pastern could be related to photosensitization from concurrent liver disease, however
these lesions were not biopsied for confirmation. The patient was discharged with
symptomatic therapy.


Similarly to Stella (Case 15), Skipper was anorectic, contributing to the increased indirect
bilirubin. In contrast to Stella, however, there was no evidence of hemolysis to further
complicate interpretation of increased indirect bilirubin. In addition, Skipper had increased
direct bilirubin, suggesting a significant cholestatic component to her liver disease that was
not evident for Stella. Skipper’s AST and CK were within reference ranges, indicating that
concurrent muscle damage was not a factor in this case as it was for Stella. Specific tests of
liver function were not performed for Skipper, but are recommended given her history. At
this time her liver function appears adequate to produce sufficient coagulation proteins, but
this is a very insensitive measure of liver function.


Liver Case 17 – Level 3
“Flower” is a 6-month-old Morgan colt presenting with decreased mentation and a delayed
menace response. According to the owner, the colt has had red urine for 10 days. The diet
consists of soft timothy hay and 12% Blue Seal sweet feed, however the colt has been
anorectic for the last week. The body condition is adequate. The patient is housed with 30
other horses including 2 healthy foals, who have access to each other and a common
pasture. On physical examination, the foal is weak, has a splayed stance, and sways when
standing. There is increased respiratory effort, with an evident heave line. A Coggin’s test for
equine infectious anemia was negative. Supportive therapy consisting of intravenous fluids
and antibiotics were provided during the first five days of hospitalization.
