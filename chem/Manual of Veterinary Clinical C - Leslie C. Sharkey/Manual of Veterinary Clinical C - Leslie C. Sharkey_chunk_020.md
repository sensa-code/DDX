###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Plasma: Icteric plasma can be caused by hemolysis or cholestasis. In general, hemolytic
anemias are regenerative and icterus is associated with a lower PCV than is seen in this
patient. With the increases in liver enzymes on the serum biochemical profile, cholestasis is
more likely responsible for the icterus, however the potential for decreased red blood cell
survival or hemolysis is suggested by the presence of spherocytes.


Leukogram: Nutmeg has a neutrophilic leukocytosis with a mild left shift. No toxic changes
are noted despite evidence of inflammation. The monocytosis also supports inflammation or
tissue necrosis.


Erythrogram: Nutmeg has a mild normocytic anemia. The increase in the MCHC is
artifactual, as is always the case since erythrocytes cannot increase their hemoglobin content
above the normal range. In this patient, the icteric plasma may account for this change, or
there may be in vitro or in vivo hemolysis. Some degree of enhanced red blood cell
destruction is indicated by the spherocytosis. The presence of spherocytes suggests an
immune-mediated mechanism for red blood cell turnover and is often used to substantiate a
diagnosis of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia when seen in large numbers. Low numbers
of spherocytes can be associated with other illnesses, especially liver disease. Based on the
indices, the anemia is likely nonregenerative. Hemolysis is usually associated with a
regenerative response, but it may take 3-4 days for a regenerative response to become
apparent following acute onset of red cell destruction. In this case there also may be marrow
suppression from chronic disease/inflammation, blunting a regenerative response. Serial
CBC’s with reticulocyte counts should be performed to evaluate a bone marrow response.
Small numbers of nucleated erythrocytes are a nonspecific finding and may accompany a
regenerative response. Nucleated erythrocytes in the absence of a regenerative response
may signal some type of endothelial cell insult with subsequent premature escape of
developing red blood cells.


Thrombocytopenia: General mechanisms for thrombocytopenia include decreased
production or increased destruction. The non-regenerative anemia combined with the thrombocytopenia could indicate a hypoproliferative marrow. However the leukocytosis suggests
that at least some lineages are productive, and other explanations should be evaluated prior


to considering a bone marrow aspirate. The presence of spherocytes can be associated with
immune-mediated disease, thus immune-mediated destruction of platelets is also possible.
Platelets may be consumed during coagulation and often decrease in disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC is unlikely in this case given the otherwise normal
coagulation panel and lack of FDPs. Clinical signs compatible with hemorrhage and
consumption of platelets by this mechanism are lacking. Activation of endothelial cells for any
reason, including hypoxia or severe systemic inflammation can trigger platelet adhesion. The
liver is an extremely vascular organ, and hepatic endothelial cell activation could be sufficient
to cause detectable thrombocytopenia. Severe acute pancreatitis is frequently associated
with thrombocytopenia, likely due to systemic inflammation.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Mild hypoglycemia: This may be due to delay in processing of the sample or may be due to
sepsis, hepatic insufficiency or neoplasia. This degree of hypoglycemia is unlikely to be
associated with clinical signs and is of questionable clinical significance. Repeat analysis may
reveal a value within the reference interval.


Increased bilirubin: See discussion of icteric plasma. The marked increases in ALP and GGT
suggest that cholestasis is the most important contributor to the hyperbilirubinemia.
Fractionation of bilirubin into direct and indirect is not considered reliable in distinguishing
hemolysis from cholestasis as a cause for hyperbilirubinemia in small animals. In fact, mixed
hyperbilirubinemia is very common.


Increased ALP and GGT: Elevation of both of these enzymes in an icteric dog strongly
supports cholestasis, however both can increase in response to other causes such as
exposure to corticosteroids. Increased ALP is a relatively non-specific finding because it is
found in multiple tissues and can be induced by hormones and drugs. For a more complete
discussion of extrahepatic causes of liver enzyme elevations, please see Chapter 2.


Increased serum ALT and AST: Mild to moderate increases in these enzymes may occur with
hepatocellular damage, however AST is less tissue specific and muscle damage as well as
hemolysis can increase this value. Elevations in these hepatocellular enzymes are of a
relatively smaller magnitude than those in the cholestatic enzymes, which could suggest
hepatocellular damage secondary to cholestasis or secondary to pancreatic disease (see
amylase and lipase). Please note that none of these enzymes are considered indicators of
liver function. Poor perfusion or hypoxia of hepatocytes secondary to anemia can injure
hepatocytes, resulting in increased leakage of enzymes into the circulation.


Mild hyperamylasemia with hyperlipasemia: Both of these enzymes are considered to be
markers of pancreatic damage, however they are not produced exclusively by that organ,
thus decreasing their specificity for the diagnosis of pancreatic disease. Hyperamylasemia
and hyperlipasemia are sometimes noted in patients with intestinal or liver disease. While
decreased glomerular filtration rate can elevate amylase and lipase activities in the
circulation, this patient is not azotemic. Currently, a suggestive constellation of clinical signs
and laboratory abnormalities are used to substantiate the diagnosis of pancreatis. While a
variety of other tests are undergoing evaluation for improving the ability to diagnose
pancreatitis (see Jimbo, Case 22), at this point no single ideal test exists.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

After evaluation of initial clinical laboratory data, abdominal ultrasound was performed. The
liver was markedly enlarged and diffusely hypoechoic, and the bile duct was distended.


Tortuous, distended tubular structures interpreted to be biliary ducts were seen throughout
the parenchyma. The ultrasound impression of the pancreas was compatible with chronic
pancreatitis and fibrosis. At surgery, the gall bladder was enlarged and contained sludged
bile. A cholecystoduodenostomy was performed and the patient improved after the
procedure with improvement of bile flow. Biopsy samples of the liver and pancreas collected
at surgery showed moderate chronic cholangiohepatitis and steroid hepatopathy with
moderate chronic lymphoplasmacytic and neutrophilic pancreatitis.


Serial serum biochemical profiles were collected during the period of hospitalization for
supportive care after surgery.

Urinalysis 14 days post surgery
Voided urine is yellow and clear
Specific Gravity: 1.012
Protein, glucose, heme, ketones: Negative
Bilirubin: 2+
Sediment: Other than a small amount of debris, sediment is inactive


Low BUN: Fluid therapy and diuresis can lower the BUN. The BUN will also decrease
because of impaired production in liver failure. Severe liver dysfunction can impair hepatic
gluconeogenesis with resultant hypoglycemia and can impair production of albumin (which is
low here) and cholesterol (which eventually increases). Because the liver enzymes indicate
some type of liver disease, liver function tests such as blood ammonia or serum bile acids
may be indicated.


Bilirubin, ALP and GGT: These values are normalizing over time, supporting resolution of the
cholestasis after surgery.


ALT and AST: Both are following the trends observed in the cholestatic indicators. Because
the hepatocellular damage in this patient was suspected to be occurring secondary to
cholestasis, decrements in these values are expected with relief of the cholestatic process.
Increases in serum ALT occur within 12 hours of liver damage, generally peak by day 5 after
an acute insult, and then fall over the next one or two weeks. In acute liver disease, a 50%
decrease in serum ALT levels over 24-48 hours is considered a positive prognostic indicator.
Although serum ALT has a longer half life than serum AST in dogs (2.5 days vs. 5-12 hours),
Nutmeg’s ALT is falling faster than the AST. This may be because extrahepatic tissue damage
is contributing to the serum AST activity or because there is ongoing, low level release from
hepatocytes. AST can be a more sensitive, albeit less specific, indicator of hepatocellular
damage.


Hypoalbuminemia with no change in globulin: Considerations for hypoalbuminia with
normal globulin generally include loss, impaired liver function, and starvation. Impaired liver
function is possible as discussed above, and in some cases albumin production in the liver is
physiologically limited because albumin is a negative acute phase reactant. Renal loss of
albumin is not supported by the urinalysis data, although the urine is dilute and a urinary
protein:creatinine ratio could be performed as a more sensitive test for glomerular loss of
protein. Patients should be evaluated for clinical evidence of loss into the third space,
gastrointestinal tract or via cutaneous lesions. Acute anorexia alone is not sufficient to cause
hypoalbuminemia, although because albumin is a protein reservoir for the body, anorexia
combined with surgery, fever, acidosis, or other causes of increased demands on the protein
pool could lower albumin.


Hypercholesterolemia: Hypercholesterolemia is commonly associated with cholestasis,
possibly secondary to upregulation of cholesterol synthesis and decreased biliary excretion of
cholesterol. Endocrinopathies such as hyperadrenocorticism, hypothyroidism, and diabetes
mellitus can increase serum cholesterol as well.


Hypomagnesemia: Disorders of magnesium are less well characterized than for most other
analytes. Hypomagnesemia is commonly observed in critical care patients and may be related
to a combination of decreased intake and possibly increased renal elimination or cellular
translocation. Magnesium is a critical ion for the function of numerous enzyme systems and
influences calcium metabolism, therefore correction of hypomagnesemia is usually
recommended.


Urinalysis: Urine specific gravity in dogs can vary widely and a single isosthenuric sample
does not necessarily signify renal disease. In the absence of azotemia or clinical evidence of
dehydration, isothenuria in Nutmeg may not be abnormal or may be in response to fluid
therapy. Based on her serum biochemistry panel, polyuria secondary to liver disease is
possible. Suggested mechanisms include decreased urea production and/or hypokalemia
with medullary washout, decreased metabolism of diuretic hormones such as cortisol, and
psychogenic polydipsia. The bilirubinuria is expected because of renal elimination of the
excess bilirubin in the blood. Mild bilirubinuria may occur in normal dogs because of
production of bilirubin by renal tubular epithelial cells and a low renal threshold for
elimination. In this case, the 2+ bilirubin in relatively dilute urine combined with the hyperbilirubinemia and elevated liver enzymes is compatible with hepatic disease.


As seen with Nutmeg, pancreatic and liver pathology often coexist; some of the liver changes
may have been related to increased endogenous corticosteroid levels. It is tempting to
speculate in Nutmeg’s case that chronic pancreatic disease led to occlusion of flow through the


bile duct with subsequent cholestasis and secondary hepatocellular damage. In contrast,
Quasi’s (Case 15) liver enzyme elevations were of a more modest degree and there was no
histologic evidence of hepatic pathology; the liver enzyme elevations may have been related to
induction by anticonvulsant therapy. Quasi had much more significant lipid changes compared
to Nutmeg despite the likely absence of significant liver disease. This may be due to a more
acute severe pancreatitis compared to Nutmeg, who seemed to have a rather low grade
pancreatic inflammation not associated with effusion or significant peripancreatic steatitis. In
many cases, it can be difficult to be sure of the exact pathophysiologic relationships and
causative factors in patients with multiple inter-related conditions. In Nutmeg’s case, ultrasound
findings were supportive of a lesion amenable to surgical correction. Laboratory work alone is
not typically adequate for this type of medical decision making.


GI Case 17 – Level 2
“Flame” is a 26-year-old Quarter Horse mare presenting for a six day history of decreased
feed intake, colic episodes, right forelimb lameness (previously diagnosed as rotation of the
coffin bone in that limb), and possible neurologic abnormalities. She had been seen rolling
and laying on her side in her stall along with aggressive pawing at the ground. She was
treated with Banamine [®] . She had been vaccinated for West Nile Virus. On presentation,
Flame was very lame on her right forelimb with sensitivity to pressure with hoof testers. She
was sweating and dehydrated with a normal body temperature. She had good appetite when
offered food, however gut sounds were not noted on either side.
