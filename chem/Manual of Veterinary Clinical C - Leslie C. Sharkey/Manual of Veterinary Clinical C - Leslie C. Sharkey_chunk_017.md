###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Bursley has a mild leukopenia with neutropenia with toxic changes that suggests
inflammation. There is a mild normocytic normochromic, apparently nonregenerative, anemia,
compatible with chronic disease or hypothyroidism. Mild hemoconcentration may mask a
slightly lower PCV.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperproteinemia with hyperalbuminemia: Hyperalbuminemia is not the result of
overproduction by the liver, but does reflect hemoconcentration. Bursely’s owners report that he
is drinking less water than is usual and dehydration is noted on the physical examination, which
support hemoconcentration as the cause for the increased albumin and hyperproteinemia.


Hypercholesterolemia: There are numerous potential causes for hypercholesterolemia (see
introduction to this chapter), however several can be ruled out in this case based on the
history and laboratory data. Bursley has not eaten recently and is not taking medications,
ruling out these as likely contributors to this abnormality. Pancreatitis or liver disease are less
likely based on Bursley’s history (no vomiting, diarrhea, or icterus) and normal serum activites
of liver and pancreatic enzymes. Endocrinopathies can be associated with hypercholesterolemia, specifically diabetes mellitus, hyperadrenocorticism, and hypothyroidism. The
absence of hyperglycemia or glucosuria makes diabetes unlikely. The alopecia might support
hyperadrenocorticism, however 95% of dogs with this condition have increased ALP, which is
not present here. Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory data, hypothyroidism
seems probable, although further testing is required to confirm this diagnosis.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Thyroid test results for Bursley included a low basal T4 (<1.0 µg/dl, reference interval 1.04.4), and decreased free T4 (0.44 ng/dl, reference inverval 0.8-2.0). Thyroid stimulating
hormone (TSH) levels were low, suggesting secondary hypothyroidism. A CT scan showed a
large enhancing mass in the region of the pituitary. Options for therapy included radiation
therapy and symptomatic therapy including thyroid hormone supplementation, however the
owner elected euthanasia due to the poor prognosis and economic constraints. At necropsy,
a 2.2 cm soft, pale yellow mass replaced the pituitary gland and expanded into the
hypothalamus. Histologically, the mass was identified as a pituitary chromophobe adenoma.


Secondary hypothyroidism is uncommon, and accounts for less than 5% of clinical cases of
hypothyroidism. The mild nonregenerative anemia is a classic abnormality described in
hypothyroid dogs, however it is not present in all cases. Decreased serum erythropoietin
levels, diminished oxygen demand by peripheral tissues, and impaired iron uptake have been
proposed as contributing factors to the anemia. The white blood cell count is variable in
these patients. More than 75% of hypothyroid dogs will have fasting hypercholesterolemia in


their serum biochemical profiles. Fasting hypertriglyceridemia may also be seen, but was not
observed in this patient. While both cholesterol production and degradation are impaired by
hypothyroidism, degradation is more effected. Thyroid hormone is necessary for the
activation of lipoprotein lipase, for the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors,
and for hepatic uptake of cholesterol from the circulation.


GI Case 11 – Level 1
“Salvatore” is a 10-year-old neutered male Maltese presenting for hemoptysis and extensive
petechia on the trunk and abdomen. Although his physical examination was otherwise within
normal limits, he had a dry, non-productive cough during the examination. Thoracic
radiographs and abdominal ultrasound failed to identify further abnormalities.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Salvatore’s hematology data includes a mild mature neutrophilic leukocytosis, and a
mild normocytic hypochromic anemia with increased numbers of nucleated erythrocytes and
severe thrombocytopenia. The neutrophilic leukocytosis may be due to inflammation, and the
anemia secondary to chronic disease. If a healthy baseline hematocrit is available for
comparison, it might be possible to determine how significant a deviation this hematocrit is
from the patient’s normal hematocrit. Because of the severe thrombocytopenia and clinical
evidence of a coagulopathy, blood loss anemia is likely. Blood loss anemias are generally
regenerative if given sufficient time, so this bleeding may be relatively acute (<3-5 days).
There are marginal signs of regeneration (low MCHC, increased polychromsia and
anisocytosis), however a reticulocyte count is needed to quantitate the response. Increased
numbers of nucleated erythrocytes in the circulation may occur as part of a regenerative
response or may be associated with some type of endothelial damage or lesions in the
hematopoietic organs. Severe thrombocytopenia in a relatively healthy patient with minimal
changes in other hematopoietic lines suggests immune-mediated thrombocytopenia,
although infectious causes such as tick-borne diseases should also be considered.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: On the day of presentation, Salvatore has mild hyperglycemia could be
compatible with stress.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia was presumptively diagnosed based on the marked
thrombocytopenia and the absence of other causes of decreased platelets. Serologic tests
for tick borne diseases such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Ehrlichial organisms were
negative. Salvatore was treated with immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. His clinical
condition improved, and subsequent blood samples were collected 14 days after initiation of
therapy.

CBC
Day 14: By this time, Salvatore’s leukogram is characteristic for a corticosteroid leukogram
and includes a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis, lymphopenia, and monocytosis.
Superimposed inflammation could account for a portion of the neutrophilic leukocytosis and
monocytosis. Salvatore still has mild anemia, however the thrombocytopenia has resolved,
and a rebound thrombocytosis is evident.


Serum Biochemical Profile Day 14
Increased ALP, GGT, and ALT: The majority of the increase in ALP and GGT is likely due to
corticosteroid induction of these enzymes (please see Chapter 2 for complete discussion of
these parameters), although some degree of cholestasis may accompany the vacuolar
hepatopathy associated with corticosteroid effects on the liver. The increased ALT could be
the result of focal hepatocellular necrosis or cholestasis secondary to corticosteroid
treatment. Canine ALT has a longer half life than AST, which may explain the discrepancy
between the values.


Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia: Increased lipolysis stimulated by corticosteroids causes increased cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the blood.


Salvatore was weaned off of his corticosteroids and recovered well. The serum biochemical
abnormalities resolved after discontinuation of prednisone. Increases in endogenous corticosteroids or treatment with pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids may have multiple
metabolic effects that could cause abnormalities in the serum biochemical profile. The
occurrence of both clinical signs and laboratory abnormalities related to corticosteroid
treatment can vary dramatically between individual animals on similar doses of hormone. The
increases in liver enzymes, cholesterol and triglycerides observed in this patient are not
always present in patients with hypercortisolism (See Chapter 2, Case 5). While liver enzyme
elevations are often present, the degree of increase is not consistent. Treatment with corticosteroids can also increase serum bile acids. Additional possible abnormalities associated
with corticosteroids include mild hyperglycemia secondary to insulin resistance. Occasionally


glucosuria may accompany the hyperglycemia if the renal threshold for reabsorption of
glucose is exceeded (about 200 mg/dl for the dog). Less commonly, BUN may be decreased
secondary to glucocorticoid stimulated diuresis; diuresis also decreases urine specific gravity
in some patients. Rarely, serum phosphate may be decreased due to increased losses in the
urine.


GI Case 12 – Level 2
“Kazoo” is a 7-year-old neutered male yellow Labrador who began vomiting four days ago.
Abdominal radiographs suggested the presence of a foreign body in his stomach, and a
tennis ball was removed via gastrotomy. He was discharged two days after surgery, and
presented this morning groggy and unresponsive. On physical examination, Kazoo is thin,
markedly dehydrated, and hypothermic. His mucous membranes are injected, and he
appears to have fluid in his abdominal cavity.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: The leukogram is characterized by a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis,
monocytosis, and eosinophilia. The neutrophils are toxic, indicating systemic inflammation.
Occasional reactive lymphocytes are compatible with antigenic stimulation. Hypersensitivity
disorders and parasitic diseases should be included as differential diagnoses for the
increased eosinophils, in addition to mast cell tumor and lymphoma (both tumors can
stimulate the production and recruitment of eosinophils in some cases). Despite the poor
condition of the patient, the lymphopenia and eosinopenia compatible with a stress
leukogram are absent. Eosinophilia in extremely stressed or ill patients can be compatible
with hypoadrenocorticism.


Erythrogram: The mild normocytic normochromic anemia is likely nonregenerative and
suggests anemia of chronic disease.


Thrombocytopenia: Both decreased production and increased consumption could contribute
to the decreased platelet counts. The activity of the myeloid lineage argues against a
generalized bone marrow disorder and lack of production, however the nonregenerative
anemia could suggest marrow compromise. Hemorrhage, vascular abnormalities,
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and immune mediated-destruction all accelerate
platelet destruction. The prolongation of PT and APTT and increase of FDPs support DIC as
the most likely cause for the thrombocytopenia. Primary immune mediated thrombocytopenia is usually associated with much lower platelet numbers than those documented here
(See Case 11 in this chapter).


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: All samples were processed appropriately, so laboratory error was ruled out.
The clinical information, inflammatory leukogram, and presence of DIC are compatible with
sepsis as a cause for the hypoglycemia. Considering the leukogram data, hypoadrenocorticism may also be a cause for Kazoo’s hypoglycemia. Corticosteroids from the adrenal gland
increase hepatic gluconeogenesis and decrease glucose uptake and utilization in peripheral
tissues. Consequently, hypoglycemia may result from inadequate corticosteroid production
