Case 17 – Level 3
“June” is a 10-year-old spayed female Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier presenting with a history
of severe watery diarrhea. The diarrhea is associated with weight loss and anorexia, although
no vomiting has been observed. Owners report that June has been drinking a lot of water.
On presentation, June is bright and responsive but weak and is 5% dehydrated. June is thin
with some muscle wasting. Auscultation is unremarkable, but she has a slightly tense
abdomen on palpation.

###### **Interpretation**

No CBC was performed.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: This mild elevation may be post-prandial or related to stress or
corticosteroid treatment. Diabetes mellitus is expected to be associated with greater
deviations from the reference interval in most cases.


Low BUN: The small decrease in BUN could be associated with inadequate liver function,
which could also explain the low serum albumin and cholesterol. Increased liver enzymes
could also be compatible with hepatic pathology. Specific liver function tests such as serum


bile acids are indicated. Alternatively, the low BUN could be related to low protein diet or
the clinical history of polydipsia and poorly concentrated urine.


Low serum creatinine: This value may be attributed to the low muscle mass described in the
history. Fluid loading and volume expansion also could contribute, however June is noted to
be dehydrated on clinical examination.


Hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia: Some proportion of the hypocalcemia is likely
associated with the hypoalbuminemia, however ionized hypocalcemia has been reported in
dogs with protein losing enteropathy (Kimmel, Kull, Melzer). It is speculated that low calcium
and phosphorus levels may be related to poor intestinal absorption or impaired absorption of
Vitamin D. Prolonged diuresis may also contribute to renal losses of phosphorus.


Hypomagnesemia: Low serum magnesium may reflect poor absorption and gastrointestinal
losses, although renal losses cannot be excluded. Hypovitaminosis D, if present, could also
contribute to low serum magnesium levels. Like calcium, the biologically active fraction of
magnesium is ionized. Measurement of ionized magnesium is recommended if suspicious
clinical signs develop.


Panhypoproteinemia: Decreases in both albumin and globulins suggests nonselective
protein losses. In June’s case, this most likely is occurring through the gastrointestinal tract.
Inadequate food intake could exacerbate these losses. Additional losses of albumin may be
occurring via the kidney, since both protein losing nephropathy and protein losing
enteropathy have been identified as clinical syndromes in the soft coated wheaten terrier
(Littman). Proteinuria is present. Because of the dilute urine, further quantification of urine
protein losses should be performed by calculating a urine protein:creatinine ratio.


Mild hyponatremia with normal chloride: The decrease in sodium may be due to losses via
the GI tract or the kidney. Anorexia rarely plays a significant role in the development of
hyponatremia. Free water retention can dilute serum sodium, however, dehydration makes
this unlikely.


Low HCO3 (acidemia): This abnormality likely reflects loss of bicarbonate containing fluid in
the diarrhea. Poor perfusion associated with dehydration could result in lactic acidosis,
however this is less likely with the anion gap within reference intervals.


Increased ALP and GGT: As discussed in Chapter 2, increased ALP in the dog is a
nonspecific change that may be associated with drug effects, endocrinopathies, circulatory
disorders, bone pathology, and cholestatic liver disease. Severe cholestatic liver disease is
unlikely with a normal bilirubin. Further questioning of the owner revealed that June had
been receiving a low dose of corticosteroids. However, the change in GGT is relatively
greater than that for ALP, which is not typical for corticosteroid effects alone. June may have
underlying liver disease, or liver enzyme elevations may occur secondary to intestinal
pathology. Liver enzyme elevation with and without corresponding histopathologic changes
have been reported in association with intestinal lymphangiectasia (Melzer).


Increased ALT and AST: These enzyme elevations suggest some degree of hepatocellular
damage. The precise causes cannot be determined and are similar to those described for
ALP and GGT.


Hypocholesterolemia: Gastrointestinal losses of cholesterol through compromised bowel
and ruptured lacteals causes hypocholesterolemia.


###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

The liver appeared normal on ultrasonographic examination. Endoscopic biopsies of the
stomach revealed mild infiltration of the lamina propria by lymphocytes, plasma cells and
eosinophils. Multiple sections of small intestine contained a similar inflammatory cell
population and dilated lacteals, which were also evident on endoscopic examination. Dilation
of the lacteals may be secondary to the inflammation and could improve with immunomodulation. As a result, June’s prednisone dose was increased, and another immunosuppressive
drug was added to the treatment regimen.


Familial protein-losing enteropathy of soft coated wheaten terriers was considered as a
potential diagnosis, however most of these dogs present at an earlier age, usually around 5
years old (Littman). The basis for this enteropathy is unclear, and evaluation of dietary factors
including gluten sensitivity have produced equivocal data (German). It may be important to
distinguish the familial syndrome from spontaneous protein-losing enteropathy because of
the poor prognosis associated with the familial disease (Littman). Scoring indices to grade
the severity of inflammatory bowel diseases have been described in an attempt to measure
response to therapy and facilitate comparison between patients, however these do not
always include laboratory parameters in the evaluation (Jergens).

Case 18 – Level 3
“Glamor” is a 1-year-old Paint mare who presents with diarrhea. She is extremely depressed
and her mucous membranes are dark red. She has ulcers on the muzzle and mucocutaneous
junctions of the mouth. There is a marked swelling of the intermandibular region and large
quantities of purulent discharge are draining from both nares and her mouth. Both
submandibular lymph nodes have draining tracts. Loud crackles could be ausculted from all
lung fields, but were worst ventrally. She has an elevated heart rate with a prolonged
capillary refill time. A large corneal ulcer covered approximately half of her right eye. Her
medical history included treatment with excessive quantities of non-steroidal antiinflammatory medications.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Glamor has a neutrophilic leukocytosis with toxic changes compatible with inflammation.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Very mild hyperglycemia: This change is compatible with stress.


Azotemia with poorly concentrated urine: Poorly concentrated urine with increased BUN
and creatinine in a dehydrated patient indicates renal azotemia, likely with a pre-renal
component superimposed. Glamor does have electrolyte abnormalities that suggest that
medullary washout may impair her ability to maximally concentrate her urine. The BUN,
creatinine, and urine specific gravity should be re-evaluated after electrolyte abnormalities
have been corrected.


Hypocalcemia with hyperphosphatemia: Glamor’s total calcium concentration may be
decreased by the concurrent low serum albumin. Large doses of NSIADS, especially in a
dehydrated horse, can precipitate acute renal failure, characterized by azotemia, hypocalcemia
and hyperphosphatemia. Hypoparathyroidism is unlikely, however poor parathyroid function
can be associated with hypomagnesemia. Glamor’s total serum magnesium is low, however
the biologically active ionized fraction should be measured to assess the potential for
magnesium-related hypoparathyroidism.


Hypomagnesemia: Low intake and increased gastrointestinal losses likely combine to cause
the hypomagnesemia. Because significant amounts of serum magnesium are protein bound,
hypoproteinemia may impact total serum magnesium values.


Hyperproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia and hyperglobulinemia: Low albumin with
increased globulins suggests either decreased production of albumin or selective loss of
albumin. Decreased production of albumin occurs with inflammation because albumin is a
negative acute phase reactant. Severe or prolonged starvation can increase albumin utilization
and decrease production, but is unlikely in this case if Glamor’s body condition is adequate.
Alternatively, severely decreased liver function can lead to deficits in albumin production. This
cannot be ruled out in this patient because specific and sensitive tests of liver function such as
blood ammonia and serum bile acids were not performed, however normal serum bilirubin,


ALP, and GGT make this less likely. Selective loss of albumin can result from glomerular
disease; losses can be quantified by measuring urine protein:creatinine ratios. Although renal
disease is strongly suspected in this case, there has been no evaluation of urine protein. Other
potential routes for protein loss include the gastrointestinal tract (there is a history of diarrhea)
and the draining tracts. Concurrent losses of globulins may be masked by markedly increased
production associated with inflammation (acute phase reactants and immunoglobulins).


Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Excessive electrolyte losses via the kidney or gastrointestinal tract are likely, although third spaces losses into the thorax or via exudative lesions are
also possible. The decrease in chloride is disproportionately greater than that of the sodium.
This can be seen if chloride is being preferentially lost or sequestered in a segment of the GI
tract, but this is generally associated with alkalemia. Typically, HCO3 and chloride vary
inversely unless there is a mixed acid/base disorder, which is likely in this case.


Decreased HCO3 with increased anion gap: High anion gap acidemia is associated with
accumulation of unmeasured organic acids. In this case, uremic acidosis or lactic acidosis seem
likely based on the clinical history and laboratory data. Because significant respiratory disease
exists and there is data compatible with a mixed acid/base disorder, blood gas analysis is
needed to fully characterize the abnormalities.


Increased AST, LDH, and CK: The increased AST and LDH could be compatible with liver
disease. Intestinal disease alone can cause secondary hepatic pathology because portal blood
delivers high quantities of bacteria, bacterial toxins, and inflammatory mediators to the liver.
These enzymes are not liver specific and also may originate from muscle. Since the bilirubin,
ALP, and GGT are within reference intervals and the elevated CK suggests muscle damage,
liver disease may not be present. Muscle damage may be the result of poor perfusion
secondary to dehydration and sepsis, hypoxemia secondary to respiratory disease, or muscle
injury during transportation or with intramuscular injections.


Tracheal wash: This is compatible with septic suppurative inflammation.
