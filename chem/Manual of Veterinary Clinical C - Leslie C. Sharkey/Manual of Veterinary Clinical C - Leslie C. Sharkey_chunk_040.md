Case 13 – Level 3
“Opie” is a 5-year-old castrated male domestic short haired cat presenting with a several day
history of vomiting and inability to hold down any food. He was taken to another veterinarian
last week because the owner thought he was drinking and urinating more than usual, however
no blood work was performed at that time. On physical examination, Opie is noted to sneeze
occasionally, does not appear to be dehydrated, and has a mass in the area of the left kidney
which could be fat. An intermittent II/VI systolic heart murmur is noted on auscultation.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: No abnormalities


Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia: Azotemia should be categorized as pre-renal, renal, or post-renal. The
isosthenuria supports the possibility of renal failure, however this does not rule out a prerenal component to the azotemia if there is clinical evidence of dehydration. Other causes for
poor urinary concentrating ability should be considered such as medullary washout
(hyponatremia and hypochloremia), osmotic diuresis associated with diabetes mellitus
(unlikely as there is no hyperglycemia or glucosuria at this time), or diabetes insipidus.


Hyperphosphatemia and hypermagnesemia with normal serum calcium: The most likely
cause of hyperphosphatemia and hypermagnesemia in this patient is decreased glomerular
filtration rate, regardless of whether the decreased glomerular filtration rate is due to prerenal, renal, or post-renal causes. Small animal patients in renal failure may have high, normal,
or low serum calcium levels, and ionized calcium levels may not correlate with total calcium
levels as they often do in healthy animals.


Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Increased renal losses of electrolytes are possible
because patients in renal failure may have abnormalities of renal tubular handling of sodium
and chloride. Measurement of urinary fractional excretion of sodium and chloride could be
performed to evaluate renal losses of electrolytes. The change in serum chloride is disproportionately greater than that of sodium. This could be attributed to vomiting of gastric contents
with high concentrations of chloride, however disproportionate changes in chloride can also
occur with acid/base abnormalities. In general, HCO3 and chloride have an inverse
relationship. This is not the case here, possibly because alkalemia due to loss of hydrogen
and chloride from vomiting is counterbalanced by uremic acidosis. This is compatible with a
mixed acid/base disorder. In many cases in which hyponatremia and hypochloremia are due
to increased gastrointestinal losses, the potassium is normal or decreased. There exceptions,
such as in dogs with salmonella, trichuriasis, or perforated duodenal ulcer, in which volume
depletion and decreased distal renal tubular blood flow results in potassium retention.
Because Opie has hypochloremia and hyperkalemia, hypoadrenocorticism is a possibility, but
is rare in cats. An ACTH stimulation test could be performed to evaluate this possibility.


Hyperkalemia: Hyperkalemia is associated with renal diseases characterized by inability to
eliminate urine, whether from urethral blockage, uroabdomen, or oliguric/anuric renal failure.
Increased intake, oversupplementation, or drug effects are not compatible with the clinical
history, and translocation due to acute inorganic acidosis also appears unlikely, although the
anion gap suggests a metabolic acidosis (probably uremic). Translocation from damaged
tissue is possible with the concurrent increase in AST and phosphorus.


Increased anion gap: The increased anion gap indicates accumulation of unmeasured anions.
Increased serum protein can cause this change, however Opie is not hyperproteinemic.
Increased organic acids such as uremic acids, ketoacids, or lactic acid can similarly elevate the
anion gap. HCO3 should decrease in response to accumulated acids; this may not occur if
there is a mixed acid/base disorder or the decrease may not be proportional to the increased
acids if buffers other than bicarbonate are being titrated.


Increased ALT and AST: Small Increases in both of these enzymes are compatible with mild
hepatocellular damage. Other tissues, including muscle and erythrocytes also contain AST.
The cause for the elevated enzymes is not apparent and cannot be determined based on the
available data.


Urinalysis: Other than the isosthenuria discussed above, the urinalysis reveals small numbers
of leukocytes. Urine culture is recommended to rule out urinary tract infection, despite the
minimal changes in the other parameters.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Because of the presence of the mass in the area of the left kidney, an abdominal ultrasound
was performed. The imaging study revealed hydronephrosis, hydroureter, and pyelectasia
suggestive for pyelonephritis. Two bacterial species were isolated from urine cultures. Note
that the urine sediment examination was unremarkable; this may occur in patients with
pyelonephritis due to minimal or absent urine flow from the affected kidney. Therefore,
normal urine sediment does not completely rule out pyelonephritis. Given the positive urine
cultures, mild sepsis is possible and could account for the liver enzyme elevations.


Opie was treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics with subsequent improvement in his
laboratory abnormalities. He was discharged on a treatment plan including antibiotics,
subcutaneous fluids, potassium supplementation, and suggestions for a low phosphorus diet.
Three weeks after discharge, Opie was doing well at home but had a persistent low grade
azotemia, indicating persistent renal dysfunction. The degree to which his remaining
functional nephrons may compensate for the previous damage remains to be determined,
and chronic renal failure may develop.


Case 14 – Level 3
“Sally” is a 7-year-old Chow mix dog. The day prior to presentation, she collapsed acutely
after going for a run with her owner and developed hematemesis and melena. On
presentation, she was hypothermic and pulses could not be detected until administration of a
2-liter fluid bolus; after which they were weak but palpable. Petechial hemorrhages were
noted on the ventral abdomen.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: Sally has a mild mature neutrophilic leukocytosis and lymphopenia on Day 1,
which is compatible with a stress/corticosteroid leukogram. Mild inflammation cannot be
ruled out, however there are no toxic changes or a left shift to corroborate this
interpretation. The lymphopenia on Day 9 is also likely attributable to corticosteroid effects;
the mature neutrophilia may not be a persistent finding with chronic stress.


Erythrogram: Polycythemia is evident on Day 1. The most common cause of polycythemia is
a relative change due to dehydration. An increase in total protein is expected with
dehydration, but may be counteracted by blood loss. Splenic contraction may also contribute
to a relative increase in circulating red blood cells. Erythrocytosis can occur in patients
compensating for cardiopulmonary disease in an attempt to improve oxygenation of tissues.
Sally may need to have further diagnostic evalvation to determine if underlying cardiopulmonary disease contributed to her collapse. Alternatively, compressive lesions of the kidney
parenchyma (cysts and tumors) can cause renal hypoxia and increased erythropoietin
production, and there is evidence of renal azotemia in this case. Much less likely is ectopic
production of erythropoietin by an extra-renal tumor or autonomous proliferation of erythroid
precursors resulting from polycythemia vera. Evaluation of the patient for cardiopulmonary
and renal lesions and measurement of erythropoietin can help distinguish various causes of
erythrocytosis if correction of dehydration does not lower the PCV.


By Day 9 Sally has a normocytic, normochromic anemia. The thrombocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia plus the clinical history are suggestive for blood loss anemia. This type of anemia
is usually regenerative given sufficient time, however anemia of inflammation/chronic disease
and loss of iron with hemorrhage could suppress a marrow response. Renal disease can also
impact erythropoiesis via reduced production of erythropoietin and the effect of uremic
toxins on erythroid precursors.


Mechanisms for thrombocytopenia include decreased production and increased destruction.
The hematemesis and melena suggest hemorrhage and increased consumption of platelets.
Hypoxic and ulcerative uremic lesions in the gastrointestinal tract predispose to bleeding
even without a coagulopathy. The presence of petechia on the ventral abdomen are
compatible with a primary hemostatic defect. Spontaneous bleeding due to thrombocytopenia alone generally occurs at platelet counts of 30 x 10 [9] /L or below, however if there is


concurrent endothelial cell insult, thrombocytopathy, or a defect in secondary hemostasis,
bleeding may occur at higher platelet counts. Defective platelet-endothelial cell interactions
occur in uremic patients and contribute to development of a coagulopathy. The normal
prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastic time seem to indicate normal
secondary hemostasis on Day 1. However, these tests lack sensitivity and only become
prolonged once factor activity is approximately 30% of normal. Enhanced fibrinolysis or
decreased degradation by the liver accounts for the increase in fibrin degradation products.
If extramarrow causes of the thrombocytopenia and non-regenerative anemia are ruled out, a
bone marrow disorder will need to be evaluated.


Serum Biochemical Profile Day 1:
Hypoglycemia: In patients with no clinical signs of hypoglycemia, artifactual hypoglycemia
due to processing errors should be ruled out by measuring glucose on a freshly collected
sample with prompt separation of serum from cells. In this case, the hypoglycemia was
verified and may have contributed to the dog’s collapse. Sepsis is a likely cause of
hypoglycemia in this case because of the clinical signs indicating breakdown of the intestinal
mucosa. However, abnormalities in the leukogram are not consistent with sepsis at this time.
Liver failure can impair hepatic gluconeogenesis, however other supportive data are lacking,
such as low BUN, hypocholesterolemia, or prolonged coagulation times. Serum bile acids
could be performed to assess liver function. Hypoglycemia due to the production of insulin
or insulin-like substances by tumors is possible in a middle-aged dog, but is rare.


Azotemia: The azotemia in combination with isosthenuria suggests renal failure, however a
pre-renal component is also likely due to dehydration (polycythemia) and poor tissue
perfusion (lack of palpable pulses on presentation). Gastrointestinal hemorrhage can further
elevate the BUN, as seen with Joe, (Chapter 5, Case 11). Glucosuria in a patient with normal
to low blood glucose is compatible with renal tubular dysfunction. Contamination of the
sample by oxidants causing false positive results on the urine dipstick should be ruled out.


Hyperphosphatemia with hypermagnesemia: The most likely cause for these elevations is
decreased glomerular filtration rate and impaired renal excretion.


Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Increased losses of sodium and chloride may occur via
the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys or via hemorrhage in this case. Dilutional hyponatremia
and hypochloremia associated with intravascular accumulation of water is an unlikely
mechanism for these changes on day 1, given the polycythemia. The hyponatremia and
hypochloremia may be exacerbated if fluid losses are replaced by drinking water or by
antidiuretic hormone stimulated free water retention. Sally’s hypochloremia is more marked
than the hyponatremia, which is mild and of questionable clinical significance. When changes
in chloride are greater than changes in sodium, disproportionate losses of chloride such as
chronic vomiting or an acid/base imbalance are suspected. Other causes of hyponatremia
and hypochloremia such as decreased dietary intake of sodium and chloride are rarely an
issue in small animal patients on commercial diets.


Increased anion gap and normal HCO3: Accumulation of unmeasured anions increases the
anion gap. Poor tissue perfusion creates the potential for lactic acidosis, and the azotemia
suggests uremic acidosis. Hypochloremia is generally associated with alkalosis, but the HCO3
is normal. A mixed acid/base disorder is possible here, and a blood gas analysis would
facilitate interpretation of these changes.
