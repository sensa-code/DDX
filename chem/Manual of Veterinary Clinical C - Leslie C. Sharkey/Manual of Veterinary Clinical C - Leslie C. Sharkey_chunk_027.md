##### Serum Proteins


Review of Proteins
Albumin makes up approximately 35-50% of the total serum protein in most domestic
animals. It is synthesized in the liver and functions as a storage pool of protein and
transporter of amino acids. In addition, albumin acts as a general binding and transport
protein that can prevent loss of constituents via the kidneys. Albumin accounts for
approximately 75% of the osmotic activity of the plasma because it is small and abundant.


Globulin proteins account for the majority of the non-albumin protein measured in the blood.
When separated by electrophoresis, alpha globulins include lipoproteins and some acute
phase reactants. Beta globulins include other acute phase reactants and some
immunoglobulins, while gamma globulins are predominantly immunoglobulins.


Measurement of Serum Proteins
Several methods are available to the clinician for measurement of serum proteins. A common
screening method used in practice is refractometry. This method is based on the refraction of
light as it passes through materials of different densities and it really measures TOTAL
SOLIDS, which includes total protein (which make up most of the total solids), electrolytes,
glucose, urea, and lipids. In health, the total solids are somewhat higher than the total
protein of serum or plasma, but conversion factors in the refractometer account for the
difference under normal circumstances. These corrections may not be accurate in disease
states, and methodologic issues may account for differences between the “total protein”
measured using a refractometer and that measured using an automated chemistry analyzer.
Therefore, we consider refractometry to be an estimate of the total protein.


Automated chemistry analyzers can usually measure total protein and albumin, and then
calculate globulin proteins as the difference between the two. These analyzers measure
colored complexes between proteins and reagents. Total protein measurement is typically
accomplished by measuring protein-copper complexes, while albumin measurement is
determined by measuring albumin binding of dyes such as bromcresol green (BCG). Binding
affinities vary by type of protein and species of the patient, and so these measurements are
also subject to some methodologic variability, but are more accurate than refractometry and
allow fractionation of albumin and globulin proteins.


Serum protein electrophoresis separates various classes of proteins by size and charge and is
superior to both refractometry and automated chemistry analyzers for protein determination.
The cost and time required for serum protein electrophoresis make it less practical for most
purposes, and it is primarily performed to distinguish polyclonal and monoclonal
gammopathies in patients who may have lymphoid neoplasms.


Interpretation of Serum Protein Data
Like many analytes, protein measurements reflect the sum of production, loss, and dilution or
concentration as a consequence of hydration status. Therefore, when considering
abnormalities of protein in a clinical patient, factors influencing production, potential sources
of loss, and hydration must all be considered. In some instances, combinations of
abnormalities may result in an albumin or globulin value within the reference interval despite
marked changes in production, loss and/or hydration status. Albumin and globulins should be
considered separately, since different factors may influence their handling by the body.


Hyperalbuminemia: Reflects excessive loss of fluid compared with protein and should be
interpreted as evidence of dehydration and hemoconcentration since
the liver does not over-produce albumin.


Hypoalbuminemia: Hemodilution in fluid retaining states such as pregnancy, heart failure,
or iatrogenic fluid overload.


Decreased production

Liver failure


Downregulation of production because albumin is a negative acute
phase reactant


Starvation if chronic or severe and associated with poor body
condition (increased use of albumin as a fuel and source of protein
also contributes)


Increased losses

Selective loss of albumin via the glomerulus (globulins may be normal
or increased)


Concurrent loss of albumin and globulin (globulins may be low,
normal, or high depending on the presence of any factors that
increase production)
Hemorrhage
Gastrointestinal loss
Third space losses into body cavities
Third space loss into interstitium
Exudative dermal loss


Increased breakdown/utilization secondary to surgery, trauma, fever,
starvation and other catabolic states


Hyperglobulinemia Dehydration (hemoconcentration)


Increased production

Inflammation can increase production of acute phase reactants
and/or immunoglobulins. This is typically a polyclonal increase,
however infectious diseases such as feline infectious peritonitis,
tick borne diseases, or leishmania rarely can cause a monoclonal
gammopathy


Neoplastic processes such as lymphoma or multiple myeloma can cause
the production of excessive amounts of a single immunoglobulin,
causing a monoclonal, or less often a biclonal gammpathy.


Globulin levels may increase just prior to production of colostrum.


Hypoglobulinemia Hemodilution


Decreased production

Rarely associated with starvation


Rarely associated with congenital disorders of the immune system


Failure of transfer of passive immunity (This is really decreased
“acquisition”)


Non-selective protein loss

Hemorrhage
Gastrointestinal loss
Third space losses into body cavities
Third space loss into interstitium
Exudative dermal loss


Case 1 – Level 1
“Belinda” is a 6-year-old spayed female German Shepherd dog with a history of unilateral hip
replacement for hip dysplasia. Belinda has presented three times within the last year for
vomiting and diarrhea related to dietary indiscretion. She presented again today for vomiting
associated with getting into the garbage last night. On physical examination, Belinda is quiet
and alert. She is very thin with a dull haircoat. No abnormalities or pain are noted on
abdominal palpation. Mucous membranes are slightly tacky but pink.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: No abnormalities are noted.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Low creatinine: The low creatinine reflects Belinda’s poor body condition and decreased
muscle mass.


Hypocalcemia: This mild change is likely related to the hypoalbuminemia.


Hypoalbuminemia: Decreased production and increased losses contribute to low serum
albumin levels. Decreased production in this case may be related to nutritional factors given
Belinda’s poor body condition. Decreased liver function is possible and may be specifically
evaluated by performing serum bile acid testing; however there are no other serum
biochemical abnormalities that would suggest liver disease. Increased losses should also be
considered with protein loss through the gut as a possible route given Belinda’s history of
gastrointestinal issues. No effusions or extensive skin lesions are noted on the physical
examination. A urinalysis should be considered to rule out glomerular loss of albumin since
globulins are within the normal reference interval.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Upon further questioning regarding Belinda’s history, it was revealed that her owner severely
restricted her food intake based on recommendations made at the time of her hip
replacement to “keep her lean.” In this case, hypoalbuminemia appears to be related to
inadequate nutritional plane, and the repeated episodes of dietary indiscretion were due to
Belinda’s efforts to get more food. The owner was given a plan to slowly increase Belinda’s
food intake to an adequate level. Eventually Belinda achieved a healthy body weight with
improvement in the quality of her coat and resolution of her laboratory abnormalities. The
next year, when Belinda presented to the hospital for heartworm testing and preventive, she
was overweight, but she appeared happy and had not eaten garbage in over a year.


Hypoalbuminemia in domestic animals on adequate commercial diets is rarely nutritional in
origin. The author has most frequently noted nutritional hypoalbuminemia in cases of animal
neglect or abandonment, although other patients with diseases causing severe or prolonged
anorexia may develop hypoalbuminemia, particularly if there are concurrent losses or
increased demand for protein. In starved animals, hypoalbuminemia may be accompanied by
low BUN and/or creatinine, while patients often are able to maintain blood glucose levels if
liver function is adequate. Belinda may be compared with Chapter 5, Case 3 (Marsali), in
which a neglected horse presented with hypoalbuminemia related to nutritional factors. That
horse was also hyperglobulinemic, suggesting that there may have been some
downregulation of albumin production in response to inflammation in addition to starvation.
Chapter 6, Case 16 (Diva) describes a missing cat who lost approximately half her body
weight. Despite this extreme nutritional deprivation, Diva’s blood glucose and albumin were
within reference intervals at presentation. Her albumin level did drop just slightly below
reference range after correction of her marked dehydration.


Case 2 – Level 1
“Dylan” is a 2-year-old neutered male Yorkshire Terrier. About 8 months ago, Dylan began to
appear weak and lethargic. He had episodes of vomiting digested and undigested food and
diarrhea that appeared to be responsive to antibiotic treatment. Last month, Dylan had
surgery for removal of ammonium biurate cystoliths. The owner reports that Dylan is polyuric
and polydipsic. Dylan has no abnormalities on physical examination.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: The mild leukocytosis is not likely to be clinically significant because individual types of
leukocytes all fall within reference intervals and there are no morphologic abnormalities that
suggest inflammation or antigenic stimulation. Dylan is not anemic, however his erythrocytes
are microcytic and mildly hypochromic. Microcytosis is most often associated with either
portosystemic shunts or iron deficiency. A low MCHC may be associated with incomplete
hemoglobinization of reticulocytes or low hemoglobin content because iron is not available
to produce it. The presence of target cells and absence of red cell fragments or
thrombocytosis could be more compatible with liver disease than with iron deficiency,
however these are weak associations and further testing may be necessary to determine the
cause of the microcytosis and hypochromasia.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: In patients with no clinical signs of hypoglycemia, artifactual hypoglycemia
due to processing errors should be ruled out by measuring glucose on a freshly collected
sample with prompt separation of serum from cells. After processing error, the most likely
cause for low blood glucose in this case is decreased liver function, possibly related to a
portosystemic shunt. Nutritional factors should not be an issue since Dylan has adequate
body condition. Dylan would be unusually young for paraneoplastic hypoglycemia. Sepsis is
unlikely in a dog presenting with a normal physical examination and CBC parameters.


Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia: Hypoalbuminemia can be due to decreased
production or increased losses. Because the liver is the site of albumin production, poor liver
function, such as occurs with a portosystemic shunt, can cause hypoalbuminemia. Selective
loss of albumin could occur with glomerular disease and should be considered because the
owners do report polyuria and polydipsia. Again, polyuria and polydipsia may also be related
to decreased liver function (See YapYap, Chapter 3, Case 7 for a mechanistic discussion).
Urinalysis should detect proteinuria if renal protein loss is occurring, however performing a
urine protein:creatinine ratio may be more sensitive if the urine is dilute. Recall that a normal
BUN and creatinine are not sensitive indicators of kidney pathology, and protein losing
nephropathy may exist with minimal to no elevations in these analytes (see Denver, this
chapter, Case 5).


Mild increase in ALT and AST: These changes are mild and indicate hepatocellular damage.
Because of close anatomic relationships, intestinal disease can lead to secondary involvement
of the liver.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

The concurrent hypoglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, and ammonium biurate stone formation are
compatible with decreased liver function; serum bile acids and imaging studies are indicated
to further evaluate the potential for liver disease. Both fasted and fed serum bile acids were
elevated. At surgery, a single extrahepatic portocaval shunt was identified and an ameroid
constrictor was placed. Biopsy specimens collected at surgery were compatible with the
presence of a shunt, but also indicated mild mixed inflammation in the periportal areas,
which could contribute to the liver enzyme elevations. Dylan did well in the immediate postoperative period, but re-presented several days after discharge from the hospital for
weakness, anorexia, and “twitching”. He was slightly dehydrated at presentation. His
laboratory work was unremarkable aside from a mild anemia, and his serum bile acids were
within reference intervals. Dylan was treated with fluids, antibiotics and medications to
control seizures, which occur rarely and for uncertain cause after surgical repair of portocaval
shunts. Dylan was discharged and, several weeks after the last presentation, was doing well
at home, other than occasional soft stools.
