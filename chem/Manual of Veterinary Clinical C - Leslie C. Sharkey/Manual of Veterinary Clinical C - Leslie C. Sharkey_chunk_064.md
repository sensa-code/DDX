Hyperphosphatemia: This abnormality is due to failure of elimination of phosphorus in the
kidney.


Hypermagnesemia: Like phosphorus, retention of magnesium is attributed to failure of
elimination through the kidney.


Hyponatremia with disproportionately greater hypochloremia and acidemia: The
corrected chloride is 98 mEq/L, so not all of the decrease in chloride may be accounted for
by forces acting on sodium concentration. Given the distended abdomen, third space loss of
both electrolytes is likely, and inability to eliminate water in the urine can cause dilutional
effects. This shift in sodium may be exacerbated by free water retention stimulated by
hypotension or low plasma osmolality. Vomiting may contribute to chloride loss. Corrected
hypochloremia is typically associated with alkalosis, however Weasel has a low bicarbonate
and increased anion gap compatible with a metabolic acidosis, therefore a mixed acid/base
disorder is suspected. A blood gas analysis will further characterize the acid/base status.
Hyponatremia and hypochloremia can characterize hypoadrenocorticism, however evaluation
of the urinary bladder should be the diagnostic priority at this time due to the clinical history.


Increased anion gap: The increased anion gap may be associated with accumulation of
uremic acids.


Very mild hyperbilirubinemia: This value is just outside the reference interval, and as an
isolated finding it would be of questionable clinical significance. The high normal PCV makes
hemolysis an unlikely cause for the increased bilirubin, while the elevations in liver enzymes
would suggest the potential for liver disease.


Increased ALP: ALP is a very sensitive indicator of liver disease, but may increase in response
to a large number of extrahepatic influences, including metabolic and hormonal disorders.
The hyperbilirubinemia and increased ALT and AST support some liver pathology, however
severe cholestasis is unlikely given the normal GGT and relatively mild change in bilirubin.
The corticosteroid leukogram is compatible with some degree of hormonal induction of ALP.


Increased ALT and AST: The elevation in ALT roughly mirrors the two-fold increase in ALP
noted above. It suggests hepatocellular damage, however the etiology is unclear. While ALT
may be slightly less sensitive to extrahepatic processes than ALP, it may still increase in the
absence of primary liver disease, including in response to corticosteroids. Elevations in AST
are less liver-specific than ALT.


Hypercholesterolemia: Because dogs are have a predominance of high density lipoproteins,
hypercholesterolemia is unlikely to cause clinical disease but is often used as an indicator of
other pathologic processes. Among the things that can promote high cholesterol in dogs are
hyperadrenocorticism (possible because of the hyperglycemia, corticosteroid leukogram, and
increased ALP), diabetes mellitus (possible because of the hyperglycemia, but not likely), liver
disease (possible because of the hyperbilirubinemia and elevated liver enzymes), and renal
disease (possible because of the azotemia). Post-prandial effects should be considered, but
Weasel has been anorectic.


Hyperamylasemia: The change in this analyte is less than two-fold, thus may be explained by
decreased glomerular filtation rate. Pancreatic or intestinal pathology may also contribute.


Abdominal fluid analysis: Despite the low protein, the increased nucleated cell count and
predominance of neutrophils suggests suppurative inflammation, which appears to be sterile
at this time. Consideration should be given to chemical peritonitis such as uroabdomen (most
likely) or bile peritonitis (less likely with clinical history and absence of bile pigment).
Comparision of abdominal fluid and serum creatinine measurements can help confirm the
presence of urine in the abdomen.


###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Weasel was sent to surgery for abdominal lavage and surgical correction of suspected urinary
bladder rupture. Four liters of urine were removed from his abdomen at surgery and a liver
biopsy was collected to investigate the potential for liver disease suggested by the liver
enzyme elevations. The day after surgery, Weasel appeared brighter and was producing
normal amounts of urine. The next day, however, he became lethargic and began vomiting. A
positive contrast cystogram revealed urinary bladder leakage through the ventral bladder wall.
He went back to surgery, where one liter of serosanguinous fluid was removed and a puncture
wound was repaired that was assumed to be the result of stay sutures or the needle used to
leak test the incision. Weasel recovered well, and was discharged on piroxicam for the
transitional cell carcinoma that was diagnosed by cytology of his bladder mass.


Weasel’s data should be compared with Sloop’s (Chapter 5, Case 18). Sloop also had a
diagnosis of uroabdomen, with a distended abdomen, azotemia, hyperphosphatemia,
hyponatremia, hypochloridemia and increased anion gap. Unlike Weasel, Sloop was
hyperkalemic and had normal serum bicarbonate compared with Weasel’s acidemia. This
variation reflects the interindividual differences that often occur between individuals with
similar or identical diagnoses. It is likely that Sloop was less able to pass significant amounts
of urine for a more prolonged period, leading to accumulation of greater amounts of
potassium, while Weasel is less able to compensate for the developing acidosis. Weasel’s
azotemia is significantly more severe than Sloop’s. One possible interpretation of this data is
that Weasel has underlying renal disease that interferes with renal regulation of acid/base
status, although differences in the pre-renal contribution to azotemia may also influence the
data. It should be noted that the degree of azotemia does not correlate with glomerular
filtration rate in a linear fashion, and direct comparison of glomerular filtration rates between
individual animals using the BUN and serum creatinine is problematic (see the introduction to
Chapter 5 for further discussion of interpretation of BUN and serum creatinine).


Case 13 – Level 2
“Astra” is a 4-year-old spayed female Boxer dog presenting with recent weight loss of 22
pounds and exercise intolerance. She has been anorexic with intermittent vomiting, but has
not had diarrhea. Astra has had two to four episodes of weakness and collapse. Astra had a
positive Lyme snap-test and was treated with antibiotics for two weeks. On physical
examination, she is very thin and has marked muscle atrophy. Her capillary refill time is
prolonged at 4 seconds, and her eyes are sunken. One of Astra’s owners instructs you to do
everything necessary to make her better, the other does not wish to pursue diagnostics
“because she’s a Boxer and she’s going to die anyway.”

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: There is a mild lymphocytosis with no associated morphologic abnormalities. This may
be attributable to the effects of epinephrine. Alternatively, antigenic stimulation can
increased lymphocyte numbers in the circulation. This interpretation would be strengthened
if reactive lymphocytes were present. Lymphoid neoplasia could be considered but is less
likely given that no atypia is described. Absence of a steroid leukogram in a severely ill dog
with appropriate history and serum biochemical data can suggest hypoadrenocortism.


There is a mild normocytic anemia with evidence of hemolysis. Because erythropoiesis never
results in excessive hemoglobin content in cells, the increase in MCHC is interpreted to be
artifactual and related to the hemolysis. It cannot be determined whether the hemolysis is in
vitro or in vivo, however the presence of small numbers of schistocytes and spherocytes is
compatible with some in vivo hemolysis. Spherocytes are often associated with immune
mediated damage to erythrocytes. Less frequent causes include zinc toxicity, snake or bee
envenomation, and erythrocyte metabolic abnormalities. In small numbers, this finding may
be non-specific and not diagnostically useful. The same is true for schistocytes, which can be
associated with abnormal vasculature, hemostatic abnormalities, or iron deficiency. HowellJolly bodies may reflect decreased splenic function, immunosuppression, or increased
erythrocyte production. The anisocytosis may be due to small numbers of immature
macrocytic erythrocytes that are too few in number to impact the MCV. Additionally, it may
be associated with the presence of spherocytes, which appear smaller because of their
change from discoid to spherical shape. In fact, the actual volume of spherocytic erythrocytes
is minimally affected. Usually hemolysis is associated with a macrocytic, regenerative anemia.
It may be that the process is too acute and there has been insufficient time for a regenerative
response to become apparent. Erythropoietic response should be assessed with a
reticulocyte count, and it takes at least 3-4 days for a significant reticulocytosis to develop
following hemorrhage or hemolysis. It is possible that the anemia is non-regenerative and
may be related to chronic disease or malnutrition. However, there is no inflammatory
leukogram to suggest inflammation.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia: Astra’s urine is not optimally concentrated, suggesting that there may be a renal
cause for the azotemia, although a pre-renal component is almost certainly superimposed.
Low glomerular filtration rate is also supported by the hyperphosphatemia, hypermagnesemia, hyperamylasemia, and possibly the hyperkalemia. Before renal azotemia can be
confirmed, other extra-renal causes of poor urinary concentrating ability should be
considered. Liver failure is unlikely given the normal bilirubin, cholesterol and high BUN,
however the albumin is low. Serum bile acids or blood ammonia are required to confirm liver
dysfunction. Osmotic diuresis is also unlikely with normal urinalysis, and there is no history of
diuretic usage. Medullary washout is possible given the hyponatremia and hypochloremia. If
medullary washout is the reason for the poorly concentrated urine, appropriate electrolyte
supplementation and fluid therapy should correct the problem.


Hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcemia: Renal failure, vitamin D toxicity, and hypoadrenocorticism can lead to these changes. Both renal failure and hypoadrenocorticism are
compatible with the other laboratory data and in both, inadequate glomerular filtration rate
for elimination of phosphorus leads to its accumulation in the blood. Hypoadrenocorticism is
a cause of hypercalcemia in dogs, but is not associated with increases in ionized calcium and
the increased calcium is therefore not pathogenic. Diminished renal excretion because of
cortisol deficiency and hemoconcentration are potential mechanisms for the hypercalcemia
and the calcium level should normalize quickly after initiation of therapy. The most common
cause of hypercalcemia in dogs is hypercalcemia of malignancy, which cannot be ruled out in
this case. Increases in ionized calcium can cause both reversible and irreversible renal
dysfunction, predisposing to the development of hyperphosphatemia. Measurement of
parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP) can help
differentiate various causes of hypercalcemia, but is not necessary in this case.


Hypermagnesemia: Decreased glomerular filtration rate is the cause for the high
magnesium.


Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin may be decreased because of inadequate production or
excessive losses. Because albumin is produced in the liver, poor liver function can result in
low serum albumin. Other laboratory abnormalities that may also occur with poor liver
function are not present (see above), however serum bile acid measurement could be
considered if other explanations for hypoalbuminemia are not applicable. The liver may
decrease albumin production in response to inflammation, however the globulin levels are
not elevated, nor is there evidence of inflammation in the CBC. Nutritional factors are an
uncommon cause of hypoalbuminemia, however Astra has experienced significant weight
loss and is in poor body condition, suggesting that albumin may be low because of
inadequate protein intake and body stores. Albumin may be diluted in patients with
accumulation of fluid in the circulation, which could also result in hyponatremia and
hypochloremia. This is most often seen with excessive accumulation of an osmole such as
glucose in the circulation, which is not the case here. Excessive selective loss of albumin from
the glomerulus is unlikely given the negative protein on urinalysis, however urine
protein:creatinine ratio may be a better measure of this in a patient with relatively dilute
urine. Nonselective loss of protein into body cavity effusion, via exudative skin lesions, or into
the gut is not suspected based on the absence of compatible clinical findings and the normal
serum globulin.


Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Low sodium and chloride in small animal patients on
commercial diets are rarely related to inadequate intake. Accumulation of free water with
dilution of these electrolytes is a potential mechanism. This can be present in association with
congestive heart failure and excessive accumulation of free water due to the effects of
antidiuretic hormone. This potentially could explain the prolonged capillary refill time and
could cause a pre-renal azotemia as well as syncopal episodes, but it would not easily explain
the gastrointestinal signs. Increased losses are the most likely cause for Astra’s hyponatremia
and hypochloremia, which are approximately proportional. Given her history, gastrointestinal
losses are possible. The potential for third space and dermal losses should be evaluated in
the context of the clinical information. Renal losses should also be considered, and can be
quantified by performing urinary fractional excretions. Patients with hyponatremia should
have low urinary fractional excretion of sodium as the body attempts to conserve the
electrolyte. Normal to increased fractional excretion under these circumstances would be
abnormal and reflect either renal disease or hypoadrenocorticism (lack of aldosterone to
signal the need to conserve sodium by the kidney).
