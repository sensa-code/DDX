# Preface

Our goal is to provide a practical and engaging resource for veterinary students, residents and
practitioners to develop and practice skills in interpretation of clinical chemistry data, using a
case-based approach. The clinical chemistry profile is an important tool for the preliminary
evaluation of the health of veterinary patients. Many texts describe the characteristics of
individual tests, however there are few resources to assist practitioners in developing the
organizational and interpretive skills needed to use this tool effectively.


The examples used in this text have been drawn from actual clinical cases reviewed by the
authors and are organized using a broad systems approach with increasing complexity to the
examples in each chapter. Because the interpretation of clinical chemistry data depends heavily
on the clinical context, brief histories and physical examination findings are included along with
other clinicopathologic data such as CBC, urinalysis, cytology or fluid analysis. Some cases also
have figures that illustrate important findings on the physical examination, imaging studies, or
microscopic evaluation of patient samples that students may find particularly helpful. Keys
discussing the interpretation of individual analytes follow the clinical presentation. At the end of
each case, a summary is given for each patient that includes a description of follow up tests and
response to treatment.


Important diagnostic considerations that we have emphasized include the effects of age and
artifacts that might be over-interpreted as indicating disease and the impact of the statistical
principles that we use to define “normal.” We have made an effort to include broad
representation of common domestic species to make the book as useful as possible to a broad
audience. In each chapter, there are “classic textbook” examples of disease processes.
However, because these cases have been drawn from the patient populations at our hospitals,
some patients have not “read the book” and should provide a diagnostic challenge that we
hope is both entertaining and enlightening. Multiple cases of some common diseases are
included to illustrate the variety of clinicopathologic findings that can be associated with the
same diagnosis depending on individual patient factors. We also include diagnostic dilemmas in
which different diseases may present with similar clinical signs and laboratory data. The
summary sections of these cases compare and contrast several different cases in the book to
illustrate how a clinician might approach distinguishing these diseases.


For many of these cases, the diagnosis was confirmed using ancillary tests or by biopsy or
necropsy. We acknowledge that the interpretation of the data for each case in this book may be
only one of several potentially correct interpretations. Mechanisms for abnormalities are the
consensus of two board certified clinical pathologists based on the existing literature at the time
the text was written, but these may be modified as veterinary science evolves. We hope that
you will enjoy using the cases in this book to hone your interpretive skills in clinical chemistry.

##### How to use the
## Manual of Veterinary Clinical Chemistry:
##### A Case Study Approach

Unlike many other clinical pathology tests that are performed by diagnostic laboratories,
clinical chemistry profile reports do not come with interpretations from the laboratory that
generated them. The purpose of this book is to assist the veterinary student, veterinary
resident, or veterinary practitioner in developing his or her skills in laboratory data
interpretation and clinical reasoning. Although short introductory segments to each chapter
provide a brief review of pertinent tests and a guide to their interpretation, this book is NOT
an exhaustive textbook of clinical chemistry and use of this manual requires some
background knowledge of clinical chemistry and veterinary medicine. The authors
recommend that the reader have a classical text reference to accompany this volume, and
several excellent potential resources are listed below.

The first chapter provides a sample method for the review of clinical chemistry data, with
an overview of the principles for the development of reference ranges and guidelines for
integrating laboratory data with other clinical information. Subsequent chapters are based
on tests of various organ systems, however “look a like” diseases with clinical chemistry
abnormalities that appear to suggest one system while originating in another will also be
included in that section (for example, a patient with an elevated serum alkaline
phosphatase level secondary to an endocrinopathy or bone disease may be presented in
the liver enzyme chapter).


Each chapter contains multiple cases from a variety of species that are designated Level 1,
Level 2, or Level 3 based on the level of difficulty of the interpretation. It is recommended
that the reader begin with introductory Level 1 cases and work forward. Although each case
can stand on its own and the reader is not obligated to work consecutive cases, the order
was carefully chosen to emphasize differentiating diseases with potentially similar laboratory
data. Ancillary hematology, urinalysis, coagulation profile, and cytology data are also
provided for each case, along with radiographs if available. Each case contains an
interpretation section where all abnormalities are reviewed, and a subsequent section where
all abnormalities are integrated into the clinical picture for final diagnosis and recommendations for further testing. When known, the clinical outcome of the case is provided since all
of the cases presented here are real, live patients. This book is designed to provide the
reader with an ENJOYABLE and PRACTICAL resource for improving skills in clinical chemistry
interpretation.


The diagnostic plans and treatment information described for these cases are
informational/historical only and should not be considered recommendations for any of
the described conditions.

# Chapter 1

##### Developing a Plan for Interpretation


Indications for the Clinical Chemistry Profile
The clinical chemistry profile is an integral component of the minimum database for most
patients. Blood may be drawn for performing a clinical chemistry profile for multiple reasons
including


1. Screening for disease in apparently healthy individuals (pre-anesthetic screens or
geriatric profiles).


2. Assessing the severity of disease: the magnitude of deviation from the reference range of
an analyte may be related to the severity of organ damage or dysfunction, but this is not the
case for all tests.


3. Resolving differential diagnoses.


4. Development of prognosis.


5. Determining drug toxicities.


6. Evaluating response to therapy using serial testing.


Because all tests have false positives, false negatives, and laboratory artifacts that could
impact the results, a diagnosis or prognosis can rarely be made on the basis of any single
test result. Conversely, disease can rarely be completely ruled out based on a single normal
test result. To arrive at a correct diagnosis, all laboratory test results must be analyzed along
with the patient’s history, physical examination findings, imaging studies, and the results of
other diagnostic procedures.


Step 1: Is the blood work abnormal or is the patient abnormal?
There are various reasons for laboratory results to fall outside of reference ranges, and some
of these have nothing to do with the presence of disease in a patient.


1. “Normally abnormal values” and how reference intervals are generated


Because the results of many clinical chemistry assays depend on the types of reagents and
analyzers that are used, reference intervals should be generated within each laboratory
whenever possible. The use of published reference intervals is sometimes unavoidable,
especially with uncommon species, but methodologic differences may cause normal patients
to have test results that fall outside these published values. Specific reference intervals also
need to be developed for patients of certain ages (i.e., neonatal), reproductive status (i.e.,
pregnant or lactating), or breeds. Keep in mind that human laboratories may accept
veterinary samples, but may not have species specific reference intervals.


Reference intervals are generated by measuring an analyte in the blood of a population of
apparently healthy animals. The mean value is calculated, and the reference range is set as the
mean plus or minus two standard deviations if the data are normally distributed. The practical
consequence of this is that approximately 5% of “normal” patients will have results that fall
outside of the reference interval (Figure 1-1). For example, the statistical probability that a
completely normal patient will have all normal results on a serum biochemical profile
containing 12 tests is only 54%!
