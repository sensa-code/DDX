Increased anion gap and normal HCO3: Accumulation of unmeasured anions increases the
anion gap. Poor tissue perfusion creates the potential for lactic acidosis, and the azotemia
suggests uremic acidosis. Hypochloremia is generally associated with alkalosis, but the HCO3
is normal. A mixed acid/base disorder is possible here, and a blood gas analysis would
facilitate interpretation of these changes.


Increased ALT and AST: Elevation of AST is severe and could reflect damage to muscle,
hepatocytes, and/or erythrocytes. Increases in ALT similarly reflect damage to muscle and
hepatocytes. A creatine kinase level could be determined to support a myocyte origin for these


elevations given the normal cholestatic enzymes and bilirubin. Since poor tissue perfusion and
hypoxia are likely causes for the damage, both liver and muscle could be affected.


Mild hypercholesterolemia: This mild increase in cholesterol is clinically insignificant.


CBC and Serum Biochemical Profile Day 9:
Sally was treated with intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and gastroprotectants for presumptive
heat stroke. Many of the differences from day 1 to day 9 reflect the fluid therapy. The PCV,
total protein and albumin are now decreased, compatible with restoration of vascular volume
in the face of whole blood loss. The continued thrombocytopenia may reflect ongoing
consumption through hemorrhage or coagulopathy, and continued monitoring for the
development of DIC is warranted.


BUN, creatinine, and phosphorus values have improved but have not normalized, indicating
ongoing renal dysfunction. Na and Cl are back within the normal range. K is mildly
decreased, and this needs to be monitored so that K depletion secondary to fluid therapy
and diuresis does not occur.


On day 9, ALT and AST have decreased, which could indicate some resolution of tissue
damage. Because AST has a shorter half life than ALT, this marked fall in AST probably
reflects decreased release from muscle. The decrease in ALT is not as dramatic and may also
reflect resolving muscle damage. There are indications of ongoing hepatocellular damage.
There is now evidence of cholestasis, likely secondary to hepatocellular swelling, as indicated
by the increased ALP, GGT and total bilirubin.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Sally shows many of the complications that may occur with heat stoke. It is likely that she was
hyperthermic the previous day, however some patients with heatstroke may present with
hypothermia due to owner’s attempts to cool them or if they present in shock (Rozanski).
Sally responded well and became brighter with resolution of the vomiting and melena, but
her appetite did not recover and she was persistently azotemic. Acute renal failure secondary
to heat stroke was suspected, and Sally was discharged from the hospital for continuing
management with fluid therapy at home (her owner was a nurse). She presented for acute
blindness three days later and was found to have severe hypertension and bilateral retinal
detachment. Several factors could have contributed to this development, including
hypertension, fluid therapy, and vascular lesions from the heat stroke. She was treated with
antihypertensive medications and her fluid rate was reduced. Her azotemia was persistent
and fluid therapy was to continue for several more weeks in the hopes that some tubular
function would recover.


The presence of glucosuria with normoglycemia suggests tubular dysfunction and is
compatible with tubular necrosis. This is more common with acute processes, although
laboratory data cannot always distinguish acute from chronic renal failure (see discussion of
Joe, Case 11). Sally’s clinical history indicates high potential for ischemic insult to the kidney:
renal damage in heatstroke is attributed to direct thermal injury to cells, reduced visceral
perfusion as blood is shunted peripherally for heat dissipation, or microvascular thrombosis
secondary to activation of the coagulation cascade (Bouchama). As with Joe (Case 11) and
Opie (Case 13), the ultimate outcome of Sally’s renal disease may take time to determine.
Her severe complications would suggest that she is more likely than Joe to suffer from
continuing health problems related to decreased renal function.

Case 15 – Level 3
“Elvira” is an 8-year-old spayed female German Shepherd dog presenting with a 7 day
history of anorexia and lethargy, during which time she has lost 12 pounds of body weight.
The owner had taken Elvira to his parents’ farm, where he thinks she may have eaten some
garbage. Elvira has been vomiting intermittently, but is drinking water. On physical
examination, Elvira was dehydrated and had icteric sclera and mildly enlarged submandibular
lymph nodes. Her abdomen was tender on palpation and she had a slightly enlarged spleen.

Spleen aspirate: Smears are hemodiluted with proportional numbers of leukocytes.
Aggregates of splenic stromal cells are present with scattered myeloid and erythroid
precursors and rare megakaryocytes. Rare hemosiderin-laden macrophages are present.
There is a heterogeneous population of lymphocytes.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: The numerical data is unremarkable. The presence of acanthocytes can be associated
with liver disease, which is supported by the clinical chemistry data. The significance of small
numbers of schistocytes is unclear, however they may reflect vascular lesions, including some
malignancies such as hemangiosarcoma. This may be a concern in this case because of the
splenomegaly and the age and breed of the dog; however there are many other potential
causes for enlargement of the spleen.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia: Urinalysis data is not available, therefore the potential for renal azotemia is
difficult to evaluate. Given the dehydration, pre-renal factors certainly contribute to the
elevated BUN and creatinine.


Mildly increased total protein and hyperglobulinemia: These changes may be due to
dehydration, however they also could be compatible with either antigenic stimulation or
increased production of acute phase reactants with inflammatory disease. There is no
indication of inflammatory disease on the CBC at this time. Less likely is the potential for a
monoclonal gammopathy, signaling possible lymphoid malignancy.


Hyponatremia with proportional hypochloremia: Hyponatremia and hypochloremia are mild
and are unlikely to be associated with clinical signs at this time. Decreased intake is rarely a
factor contributing to low sodium and chloride. These electrolytes may be diluted if there is
excessive retention of free water, however, given the dehydration, this is an unlikely
mechanism for the alterations. In this case, increased losses by gastrointestinal or renal routes
are most likely. Urinary fractional excretion of sodium and chloride could be performed to
quantify renal losses of electrolytes, which should be low under these circumstances if the
kidney is functioning. High urinary fractional excretion of these electrolytes would be
inappropriate and consistent with renal disease. Hypoadrenocorticism is less likely given the
hypokalemia. Third space and cutaneous losses should also be considered if compatible with
clinical signs.


Hypokalemia: In contrast to sodium and chloride, low intake can contribute to the
development of hypokalemia, especially in combination with increased losses. Potassium
could be lost via the same routes as sodium and chloride.


Hyperbilirubinemia: Hyperbilirubinemia is often the result of liver disease or hemolysis.
Significant hemolysis is unlikely when the PCV is within the reference range. The elevations in
the liver enzymes suggest liver disease; specifically the increased ALP and GGT are
compatible with cholestasis. Decreased hepatocellular uptake can also be associated with
decreased liver function of any cause, and sepsis can result in diminished hepatocellular
uptake of bilirubin. Sepsis is unlikely in this patient and generally can only account for
relatively modest elevations in bilirubin.


Increased ALP and GGT: As noted above, increased ALP and GGT with hyperbilirubinemia
indicate cholestasis, however there are numerous extrahepatic factors and other liver
diseases which can increase ALP and GGT (see Chapter 2 for more details).


Increased ALT and AST: Elevations in these enzymes often indicate hepatocellular damage,
however they indicate nothing specific about the etiology of the damage, nor the potential
reversibility of the liver disease.


Hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia: Decreased glomerular filtration rate can increase
both enzymes, however pancreatic disease is also possible. Some patients with pancreatitis
can have normal amylase and lipase.


Coagulation profile: Normal


Spleen aspirate: compatible with extramedullary hematopoiesis. The spleen is a large and
heterogeneous organ; the presence of this common and benign change does not rule out
the potential for other processes, including neoplasia, in the organ.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a thickened spleen with nodules (see above cytology),
however the liver and pancreas were within normal limits. Elvira was treated with fluids and
nutritional support, after which the azotemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and liver enzyme elevations
improved. Her presumptive diagnosis was pancreatitis with secondary cholestatic liver disease;
normal ultrasound findings were thought to be evidence of a resolving process.


One week after discharge from the hospital, Elvira’s bilirubin was down to 4.7, however her ALT
and ALP were persistently elevated and she was still azotemic. At this time, nephropathy was
considered a potential explanation for persistent azotemia and isosthenuria. Four days after
that, her bilirubin had halved, but other abnormalities were unchanged. One month after
discharge from the hospital, she was still azotemic and mildly hyperbilirubinemic, however her
liver enzymes had normalized. At this time, Leptospirosis titers were performed.


_L. canicola, hardjo, icterohemorrhagica:_ negative
_L. grippotyphosa:_ 1:806
_L. bratislava:_ 1:800
_L. pomona:_ 1:6,400


Elvira was treated for Leptospirosis with appropriate antibiotics. Over the next year, she
developed clinical signs and laboratory abnormalities characteristic of chronic renal failure,
however she had good quality of life at home with daily administration of fluids and other
supportive management. Sixteen months after her initial presentation, she presented in oliguric
renal failure and was euthanized.


At the time of the first hospitalization, Elvira’s azotemia was presumed to be pre-renal and
secondary to pancreatic/hepatobiliary disease. This assumption delayed diagnosis of concurrent
renal disease and underscores the need for determination of urine specific gravity for
appropriate interpretation of BUN and creatinine. Leptospirosis should be a consideration in any
dog with the combination of renal azotemia and evidence of liver disease, especially if there is a
history of exposure to livestock. This case should be compared with Hilda (Chapter 2, Case 18),
another case of leptospirosis with laboratory evidence of renal compromise and liver disease.
Diagnosis in Hilda’s case was further complicated by her clinical history of eating pastries,
cheese cake, and butter, however her laboratory work and her presentation with clinical signs of
dehydration and poorly concentrated urine prompted immediate evaluation for causes of renal
azotemia. Diagnosis in both of these cases was made using documentation of single markedly
elevated titers for _Leptospira spp._ in the presence of compatible clinical signs. Polymerase chain
reaction testing of urine is also available. While the negative predictive value of these titers
appears to be high, some clinically normal dogs may have positive titers (Harkin, Harkin).

Case 16 – Level 3
“Tinker” is a 12-year-old spayed female domestic short haired cat with a history of weight
loss, vomiting, diarrhea, polyuria, and polydipsia. On physical examination, she was thin with
an unkempt haircoat. She had tachycardia, however auscultation was difficult because of
persistent growling. Her kidneys felt slightly small, but abdominal palpation was otherwise
unremarkable.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: There is a neutrophilia and lymphopenia present, suggestive for a corticosteroid
leukogram. However, inflammation cannot be ruled out, especially given the evidence of
urinary track infection seen in the urinalysis. The PCV is at the low end of the reference range
and should be monitored, especially if Tinker is dehydrated.
