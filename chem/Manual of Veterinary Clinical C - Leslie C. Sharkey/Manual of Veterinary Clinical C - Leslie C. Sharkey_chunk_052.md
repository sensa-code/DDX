###### **Interpretation**

CBC: No abnormalities


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: This may be attributable to stress, however neonatal foal serum glucose may
be higher than adults, with an average of 135-150 mg/dl (Vaala).


Azotemia and hyperphosphatemia: Common causes of increased serum phosphorus include
skeletal growth in immature horses, endurance exercise, and decreases in glomerular
filtration rate secondary to acute renal failure or pre-renal causes. The signalment of this foal
suggests that at least part of the hyperphosphatemia is age-related. The average phosphorus
of a neonatal foal is 5-6 mg/dl. However General is also azotemic. Because of high milk
intake, foals generally produce large volumes of dilute urine, and specific gravity readings of
1.018-1.025 are indicative of maximal concentration (Madigan). General’s urine specific
gravity is somewhat concentrated, so the azotemia is likely pre-renal.


Hypoproteinemia: Low total protein in neonatal animals may reflect the increased total body
water content, however albumin is within reference range. The globulins are often lower in
young animals because of a relatively naïve immune system. Given the perinatal history,
evaluation of passive transfer status using a test such as IgG is recommended.


Hyperbilirubinemia: Neonatal foals have higher serum bilirubin values than adult horses
(average 4.3 mg/dl), however this is still elevated even for a foal. In horses, anorexia should
always be considered as a cause of hyperbilirubinemia. Hemolysis is another possible cause
of hyperbilirubinemia. Although his PCV is normal, this foal should be monitored for evidence
of developing neonatal isoerythrolysis.


Increased ALP: This is likely an age-related change due to increased release of the bone
isoform of ALP secondary to skeletal growth and development. Bone disease is a
consideration because of General’s clinical presentation.


Increased CK: Increased CK indicates muscle damage and is compatible with the history of
dystocia and lameness. CK may be a more sensitive indicator of muscle damage than AST.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

General was treated with nutritional supplementation after the death of his mother. Over a
few days, his mobility improved and his prognosis was considered good. Repeat blood work
24 hours after presentation showed diminished azotemia and normal CK. His serum
phosphorus normalized with a persistently elevated ALP, indicating that the initial hyperphosphatemia was more likely related to the pre-renal azotemia than bone growth. Unless
otherwise specifically indicated, reference ranges for domestic animal species are usually
generated in adult animals. It is important to consider the potential impact of signalment,
including age, on “normal” values for clinical pathology data. This case can be compared


with Spunky (Chapter 2, Case 1), a puppy with age related changes in calcium, phosphorus,
and ALP. Interpretation of data on analytes that could be influenced by age should be
considered in light of clinical signs and other laboratory data. For example, because General
had a high risk history and concurrent azotemia, his hyperphosphatemia was considered to
potentially be related to decreased glomerular filtration rate, while Spunky had hyperphosphatemia but no other laboratory data suggesting alterations in glomerular filtration rate. In
both General and Spunky, the absence of any other liver enzyme elevations to accompany
the increased ALP was taken as evidence of an age-related change rather than an indication
of liver disease. In General, this interpretation was slightly more difficult because of the
concurrent hyperbilirubinemia, which could be compatible with cholestasis/liver disease.
Here, species variation plays a role in interpretation, because anorexic horses commonly have
hyperbilirubinemia unrelated to hepatic pathology.

Case 9 – Level 2
“Nevada” is a 17-year-old Hackney cross gelding. Five days prior to presentation, Nevada
had an episode of colic, which was treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication.
After treatment, Nevada’s signs of colic improved, however he did not regain his attitude or
a normal appetite. He has been polyuric and polydipsic for the past two days. On
presentation, Nevada was bright, alert, and responsive. He had increased dental plaque and
a soft systolic heart murmur with maximal intensity over the mitral valve.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: The slight increase in fibrinogen could be compatible with mild inflammation.
While the site of the inflammation cannot be determined from this value alone, there may be
residual inflammation from the colic. Acute phase reactants such as fibrinogen may be more
sensitive indicators of inflammation in some species, therefore the normal leukogram does
not rule out inflammation.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia: Azotemia with isosthenuria usually suggests renal failure, as long as extrarenal
factors that could impair renal concentrating ability are ruled out (for example osmotic
diuresis, medullary washout, and some endocrinopathies, see Chapter 5). Some authors
describe a relatively high BUN/creatinine ratio of greater than 10:1 with chronic renal failure
in horses versus a ratio less than 10:1 with acute renal failure. It is common for pre-renal
azotemia to become superimposed on primary renal failure in dehydrated patients. The colic
episode may have exacerbated previously subclinical chronic renal disease in this patient,
causing fluid deficits.


Hypercalcemia with normal phosphorus: Hypercalcemia with normal to low phosphorus is
often described in equine patients with chronic renal failure. This is in contrast to small animal
patients, who generally have hyperphosphatemia and a somewhat unpredictable calcium
status. PTH does not appear to be responsible for the hypercalcemia in horses. Rather it
appears to be related to dietary intake of calcium and may reflect inability of the
dysfunctional kidneys to eliminate dietary calcium. Hypercalcemia in horses with chronic renal
failure is often worse on alfalfa hay and may improve on grass hay. Therefore, not all horses
with chronic renal failure will have hypercalcemia. Horses with acute renal failure may be
more likely to have low total serum calcium.


Mild hypochloremia with low normal sodium: Hyponatremia and hypochloremia may be
noted in horses with both acute and chronic renal failure. Previous isotonic or hypertonic fluid
losses associated with colic and replaced with oral intake of water may further depress serum
electrolytes. Pain associated with colic can result in sweating, which can be another
significant source of sodium and chloride loss. Mild hyperkalemia has been described in
horses with chronic renal failure or severe acute renal failure, but was not present in Nevada
at presentation.


Increased GGT: In an adult horse, increased GGT is evidence of liver damage or cholestasis.
Liver damage may be attributed to the previous episode of colic, or associated with hepatic
lipidosis from the recent anorexia. Severe cholestasis is unlikely with the normal bilirubin.


Increased AST and CK: AST is present in multiple tissues and elevations can be difficult to
interpret. Nevada’s increased GGT and AST suggests some liver pathology, however the
concurrent increase in CK indicates that muscle damage is also likely and may be responsible
for some of the increase in AST. Like GGT, elevations in AST are not specific as to the
etiology of the tissue damage. Increases in CK can be associated with intramuscular injection,
trauma during transportation, and muscle damage with down or rolling animals.


Urinalysis: Normal horse urine is often cloudy because of high mucus content and the
presence of calcium carbonate crystals, while horses with renal failure may have clear urine
because of the production of high volumes of dilute urine and relative calcium retention
(Figure 6-3). Herbivore urine is generally alkaline, however, the urine pH may decrease with
uremic or lactic acidosis.

with calcium carbonate crystals.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Nevada was treated with intravenous fluids and his azotemia resolved. The combination of
laboratory abnormalities and clinical signs, including polyuria/polydipsia and increased dental
plaque, were considered to be consistent with chronic renal failure. His episode of colic
resulted in temporary decompensation and the development of pre-renal azotemia
superimposed on his more chronic renal disease.


Nevada may be compared with Margarite (Chapter 5, Case 9). Margarite had more advanced
disease than Nevada, and in addition to the abnormalities shared with Nevada, had hypophosphatemia, and hyperkalemia. As with small animal patients, anemia may be present in horses
with renal failure, although it was not present in either Nevada or Margarite at presentation.


Nevada may also be contrasted with Faith (Chapter 5, Case 19) or General (Case 8), cases of
pre-renal azotemia. Note that Faith had hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, which is more
common in horses with pre-renal azotemia or acute renal failure than in horses like Nevada or
Margarite with chronic renal failure. Faith had concentrated urine at the time of presentation,
which would suggest that she had adequate renal function. However, she was treated with
high doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, which can be nephrotoxic under
some circumstances. Other cases of renal disease in large animals include Forsythia (Chapter
5, Case 20, llama) and Lucinda (Chapter 5, Case 25, goat).


Case 10 – Level 2
“Austin” is a 6-year-old Labrador Retriever/Beagle mix, castrated male dog. He presented
with a 2 week history of lethargy and poor appetite and a 3 day history of vomiting. His
owners have noted dark stool over the past few days. Three years previously, Austin had been
evaluated for elevated liver enzymes, and chronic active hepatitis and fibrosis was found on
biopsy. Austin was treated at the referring clinic with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. He was
transferred to the referral institution after he developed ascites. On physical examination,
Austin has mild icterus and moderate ascites. While he is very lethargic, he does not appear to
be showing clinical signs of hepatic encephalopathy.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: The mild lymphopenia is compatible with a corticosteroid/stress effect. There is
currently no mature neutrophilia or monocytosis, but these can be less consistent features of
the corticosteroid leukogram.
