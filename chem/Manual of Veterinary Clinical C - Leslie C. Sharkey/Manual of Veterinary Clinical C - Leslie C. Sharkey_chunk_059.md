Bicarbonate
Bicarbonate is a major body buffer participating in acid/base homeostasis. It is produced
from water and carbon dioxide by red blood cells, renal tubular cells, and cells in the
stomach lining.


Increased Serum Bicarbonate (alkalosis)
1. Loss of hydrogen ion


2. Gain of bicarbonate


Decreased Serum Bicarbonate (acidosis)
1. Loss or depletion of bicarbonate


2. Increased production of acid


3. Decreased excretion of acid


Anion Gap
The anion gap is a calculated value used to approximate anions that are not specifically
measured on the serum biochemical profile. Because electrochemical neutrality must be
achieved, the “anion gap” may be estimated by the difference in measured cations and anions.


Anion gap=([Na [+] ] + [K [+] ]) – ([Cl [–] ] + [HCO3 [–] ])


Normal components of the anion gap include negatively charged proteins, organic anions,
phosphates and sulfates. Fluctuations in the serum content of these components can
influence the anion gap, as can accumulation of a variety of anionic organic acids such as
lactic acid, ketoacids, or metabolites of compounds such as ethylene glycol. Therefore,
increased anion gap often implies acidemia.


Increased Anion Gap
1. Increased production or accumulation of endogenous acids


2. Increased exogeneous anions as a result of toxicity or metabolism of toxic compounds


3. Hyperalbuminemia associated with dehydration


Decreased Anion Gap (nonspecific change that does not often impact clinical
decision making)
1. Increased cationic proteins such as gammaglobulins


2. Hypoalbuminemia

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Mild mature neutrophilic leukocytosis that could be compatible with mild inflammation.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Marked hyperchloremia: Physiologic explanations for the abnormality would be difficult to
formulate. Some type of artifact or interference is suspected based on the absence of other
abnormalities. In this case, consultation with clinicians regarding any potential effects of
treatment revealed that the patient had received a loading dose of potassium bromide used
for his seizure disorder. This was detected by the ion specific electrode as chloride.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Continued monitoring was suggested and diagnostic imaging was recommended to rule out
intracranial lesions. The owners elected euthanasia because of cost and guarded prognosis,
and necropsy was allowed. Unfortunately, gross and microscopic examination of the central
nervous system failed to reveal lesions, which may have been biochemical or metabolic in
nature, and thus not visible.

###### **Interpretation**

Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: This value is difficult to interpret in the absence of any clinical data. As always,
artifacts should be considered. In this case delayed separation of serum from cells may
artifactually depress glucose levels. A profoundly low glucose such as this is likely to be
associated with clinical signs, including seizures. Causes of true hypoglycemia include insulinoma
and less frequently other tumors that produce insulin-like substances, and sepsis. Starvation
usually results in mild hypoglycemia and then only with severe or prolonged deprivation.


Hyperphosphatemia with normal calcium: Hyperphosphatemia is often associated with low
glomerular filtration rate, although this goat is not azotemic. Age related increases in


phosphorus may be noted in young growing animals, however this goat is mature.
Hypoparathyroidism should be considered, although the calcium may be decreased in these
patients. If hypoparathyroidism is compatible with the clinical presentation, ionized calcium
may be performed as a superior indicator of the biologically active form of the mineral.
Finally, phosphorus may be released from cells with trauma or necrosis, which appears
possible based on the hyperkalemia, elevated AST, and marked increase in CK.
Rhabdomyolysis and tumor lysis syndrome are two specific conditions in which tissue
destruction may lead to marked hyperphosphatemia.


Hypoproteinemia: Although the total protein is low, both the albumin and globulin levels are
within reference intervals. Because both are at the lower end of the intervals, these values
should be monitored.


Hyperkalemia: This value is extremely high and may be incompatible with life. The
combination of hyperphosphatemia and hyperkalemia may be associated with anuric/oliguric
renal failure, however this patient is not azotemic. Additional clinical history could provide
more information about the potential for urinary obstruction, which is common in goats. As
described above, the concurrent hyperphosphatemia and hyperkalemia can also reflect tissue
destruction; this diagnosis is supported by other data. Hemolysis can increase potassium
levels in the serum of some species or breeds characterized by red blood cells with high
potassium content. Iatrogenic hyperkalemia may be caused by excessive potassium supplementation, or by treatment with potassium sparing diuretics, drugs that inhibit the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system, heparin, or potassium penicillin G. Hyperkalemia may be
associated with diabetes mellitus because of failure of insulin mediated uptake of potassium
by cells. Hypoaldosteronism prevents adequate renal elimination of potassium, and some
gastrointestinal disorders are characterized by potassium accumulation.


Increased ALP: Increased ALP may be associated with hepatobiliary disease, however the
normal GGT makes this less likely. In this case, bone pathology or intestinal pathology also
could be considered, and it was later determined that this goat had undergone an
orthopedic surgical procedure prior to death.


Increased AST: This abnormality indicates tissue damage. The marked elevation of CK and
normal GGT suggest extrahepatic damage, likely muscle.


Increased CK: The massive increase in this enzyme suggests severe muscle damage.


Increased Anion Gap: Increases in unmeasured anions may be due to poor tissue perfusion
or from release from damaged tissue.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Upon further inquiry into the clinical history of this patient, it was discovered that the sample
collection was post-mortem. This explains the marked increase in intracellular constituents
(cellular translocation), which are released as tissues breakdown after death. This makes
interpretation of clinical chemistry data collected after death very difficult, so samples should
be collected prior to death whenever possible. Similar but less dramatic increases in
intracellular constituents were present in Chapter 6, Case 15 (Zinger), a cat with renal failure
and thromboembolic episodes that led to tissue necrosis. Interpretation of abnormalities was
less clear in Zinger, however, since the renal disease itself could have resulted in failure of
renal excretion of phosphorus and potassium and the elevation in CK.


Case 3 – Level 1
“Serengeti” is an 8-year-old intact male German Shepherd presenting with a history of eating
garbage many days ago. Since then, Serengeti has been vomiting once a day, and has been
anorexic and lethargic. He had diarrhea the day he ate the garbage, but after that has had
no feces and has been straining to defecate. He was treated with antibiotics yesterday. On
physical examination, Serengeti has a pendulous abdomen and muscle wasting with a
prominent spine. He is extremely depressed with increased respiratory rate. An oral
examination is not possible because, despite his depression, Serengeti still has the energy to
try to bite. His owners are concerned about cost of medical care.

Abdominal Fluid Analysis
Pre-spin appearance: orange and cloudy
Post-spin appearance: colorless and clear
Total protein: 3.6 gm/dl
Total nucleated cell count: 24,300/µl


Cytologic description: Smears consist of 88% nondegenerate neutrophils, 2% small
lymphocytes, and 10% large mononuclear cells. No etiologic agents are seen. Large numbers
of round to oval cells are present at the feathered edge of the smears (Figure 7-1). These
cells are characterized by scant to abundant deeply basophilic to clear cytoplasm. Most have
numerous small clear vacuoles in the perinuclear area and cytoplasmic blebbing is noted.
Each cell contains a single large round to oval nucleus with coarsely stippled chromatin. The
nucleus is often peripheralized by the vacuoles. Occasional ballooning signet ring cells are
present. Anisocytosis and anisokaryosis are marked; the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio is
moderate but variable. Signet ring cells have large and prominent nucleoli.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Serengeti has a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis and lymphopenia compatible with a
corticosteroid response. Mild concurrent inflammation is also possible due to the
inflammatory nature of the abdominal fluid; however no toxic changes or left shift are noted
at this time. Serengeti is also polycythemic. In this case, a history of vomiting and diarrhea
with poor food intake is compatible with dehydration and a relative polycythemia.
Hyperproteinemia and hypernatremia may accompany relative polycythemia, but are
inconsistent findings because of concurrent protein and electrolyte losses that can occur with
diseases leading to dehydration. In this case, both gastrointestinal losses by vomiting and
diarrhea and third space sequestration with abdominal fluid accumulation obscured the
effects of dehydration. Polycythemia may also occur as a rare neoplastic condition with
autonomous proliferation of erythroid precursors (polycythemia vera) or may occur in
compensation for renal oxygen deficits with cardiopulmonary disease or some kidney lesions.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Likely sources of electrolyte loss in this patient include
losses from the gastrointestinal intestinal tract and third space sequestration in the
abdominal cavity effusion. If hypertonic fluids are lost, this will lead to relatively greater losses
of electrolytes than water, resulting in low serum electrolytes. When isotonic fluids containing
proportional amounts of water and electrolytes are lost, fluid losses are frequently replaced
by water consumed by the patient, further diluting remaining electrolytes. Disproportionate
decreases in chloride (the corrected chloride is 99 mEq/L) are compatible with vomiting or
fluid sequestration. Currently, there are no abnormalities in the serum bicarbonate, although
it is approaching the upper limit of the reference interval. Serum chloride and bicarbonate
usually vary inversely, and loss of fluid from the upper GI tract is often associated with
alkalosis attributed to loss of hydrogen. Concurrent metabolic alkalosis and acidosis could
combine to result in a serum bicarbonate value within the reference interval if a mixed
acid/base disorder is present. Blood gas analysis may be required for more complete
information about Serengeti’s acid/base status. In addition to increased losses, serum
electrolyte levels may be low due to decreased intake, though this usually does not result in
significant lowering of serum sodium and chloride.


Hyperkalemia: Hypoadrenocorticism should be considered, given the combination of
hyperkalemia, hyponatremia and hypochloremia in this patient. The corticosteroid leukogram
would be unusual in a patient with adrenal insufficiency, while the history of gastrointestinal
signs and weakness is compatible with Addison’s disease. Some types of gastrointestinal
disease or effusions may also be associated with the electrolyte pattern seen in Serengeti.
The mechanism is not always clear, but it is speculated that volume depletion and low renal
tubular flow rates may contribute to the development of hyperkalemia. Unless there is
impaired renal excretion, increased intake of potassium rarely causes hyperkalemia, although
this may be seen if intravenous fluids are administered that contain excessive amounts of


potassium. Treatment with beta-blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
interferes with potassium excretion in the absence of renal disease. There is no evidence of
tissue trauma or acid/base abnormalities that would trigger translocation of potassium from
cells. In the context of the clinical history, uroabdomen seems unlikely, however measurement
of abdominal fluid creatinine could be performed to rule out this possibility.
