Increased AST (30x) and CK (79x) with normal GGT: AST may increase with either
hepatocellular damage or muscle damage, while the markedly increased CK is strong
evidence for muscle damage. In combination with a normal GGT, the most likely source for
the elevated AST in this patient is muscle.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Acute overwhelming inflammation (sepsis and/or metritis), muscle trauma, anorexia, and stress.


Immediately after admission, Beauty was placed under general anesthesia in an effort to
remove the fetus via controlled vaginal delivery, but the dead fetus was too large. She was
taken to surgery for a cesarean section through a ventral midline approach. There were no
surgical complications, and she was treated post-operatively with broad-spectrum intravenous
antibiotics and Banamine [®] . Oxytocin was administered, and the uterus was flushed daily with
dilute betadine and lactated ringer’s solution for five days. Antibiotics were infused into the
uterus three times. Beauty did develop mastitis after surgery that responded to antibiotic
infusion, and several of her skin staples had to be removed for drainage of a mild infection of
her incision. Beauty was discharged and had an uneventful recovery at home.


Beauty’s case illustrates that the need to distinguish extrahepatic causes of enzyme
elevations is important in the horse as well as in small animals. The measurement of SDH,
which is more liver specific than AST in horses, will help the clinician distinguish increases in
AST caused by hepatocellular damage versus increases caused by muscle damage. Anorexiainduced increases in bilirubin in horses can further complicate data interpretation. As noted
previously, the possibility of sepsis as another potential cause for hyperbilirubinemia should
be considered.


Liver Case 5 – Level 1
“Greta” is a 9-year-old female spayed German Shepherd dog with a history of watery stools.
A previous work-up resulted in a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, for which Greta
has been treated with 20 mg of oral prednisone per day. This has resulted in improved
clinical signs, however lately she has developed a distended abdomen, thin skin, and hair
loss. She is also polyuric and polydipsic.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Mature neutrophilic leukocytosis with lymphopenia: The mature neutrophilic leukocytosis
could indicate inflammatory disease, however in the absence of toxic changes or a significant
left shift, it may be more compatible with a corticosteroid leukogram. The lymphopenia
supports this interpretation. Other elements of steroid-induced changes in the leukogram in
dogs include a monocytosis and eosinopenia, neither of which are seen in this case. Some
patients may not have all components of the steroid leukogram at once.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Increased ALP (25% increase) and GGT (16x increase): These enzymes are classically
thought of as cholestatic enzymes. However, as is seen here, their production may be
induced by corticosteroids in the absence of cholestatic disease. Note the serum bilirubin is
within the reference interval.


Increased ALT (3-4x increase): This enzyme is used to detect hepatocellular damage, and
will also increase with administration of corticosteroids.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Steroid hepatopathy


Greta’s liver enzymes were within the reference interval until her treatment with prednisone
began. Although liver disease is possible, steroids are the most likely cause of the increased
liver enzymes activities seen here. To confirm this interpretation, it is possible to measure the
corticosteroid-induced isoenzyme of ALP, which is most often accomplished by levamisole
inhibition. This test is based on the use of levamisole to suppress activity of the liver and bone
isoenzymes in the serum sample. In dogs with normal serum ALP, the corticosteroid induced
isoenzyme makes up about 5-20% of the total ALP. Because hepatobiliary disease has been
reported in association with certain types of inflammatory bowel disease, the possibility of
liver disease in Greta should remain on the list of differential diagnoses, especially if liver
enzyme elevations persist following withdrawal of corticosteroid therapy. As always, the
interpretation of elevated ALP in the dog depends significantly on history, clinical signs, and
other laboratory work because of the numerous factors that can cause increased ALP.


In general, administration of corticosteroids causes greater increases in ALP than GGT,
although the degree of increase depends on dose, method of administration, type of
corticosteroid given, and individual sensitivity to the drug. Increases in ALT that are noted in
patients with steroid hepatopathy may be related to areas of focal necrosis /cholestasis that
are seen with the vacuolar hepatopathy induced by steroids.


Because of Greta’s iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism, her prednisone was tapered to a lower
dose. Consequently, her inflammatory bowel disease worsened, so another immunosuppressive agent was added to her treatment. Two months after this change in her therapeutic
protocol, her clinical signs were under good control. Her liver enzyme values had decreased
but were still slightly elevated (ALP 217 IU/L, GGT 41 IU/L, ALT 118 IU/L).

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Lymphopenia: The mild lymphopenia here may be attributable to stress, however a mature
neutrophilic leukocytosis does not accompany it to support a corticosteroid leukogram.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Differentials include a stress response, post prandial effects, or diabetes
mellitus. Both acute epinephrine release or more chronic corticosteroid release (stress) can
cause hyperglycemia. Epinephrine induced hyperglycemia should be transient. The
lymphopenia in the CBC supports a stress response. The degree of hyperglycemia is
relatively mild, and while glucosuria and ketonuria are not present, this does not completely
rule out diabetes mellitus. The clinical signs here are nonspecific and also do not help rule
out diabetes. A serum fructosamine level would better reflect chronic glycemic control.
Feline pancreatitis may be associated with either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.


Increased ALP (4x): Nonspecific induction of ALP is rare in the cat compared to the dog, so
increased ALP is always considered significant in cats. Increased ALP will be seen with many
feline liver diseases, in addition to hyperthyroidism and diabetes mellitus. In contrast, corticosteroids do not usually increase ALP in cats.


Increased ALT and AST (2-3x): As for dogs, these increases indicate hepatocellular damage
associated with liver disease, hypoperfusion, or the effects of drugs, toxins, or hormones,
including increased thyroid hormone. It is not possible to confirm a specific cause of the
increased liver enzymes based on blood work alone.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Liver enzyme elevations with mild hyperglycemia and lymphopenia.


In this case, hyperthyroidism should be the primary differential diagnosis. This is based on a
combination of the clinical history (weight loss, tachycardia with gallop rhythm, vomiting and
diarrhea) and the laboratory work. Most primary feline liver diseases will be associated with
some degree of hyperbilirubinemia, which is absent here. While diabetes cannot be ruled out
based on the initial laboratory data, the hyperglycemia is mild without significant
abnormalities in the urinalysis. A diagnosis of hyperthyroidism must be confirmed by running
a total T4. Both hyperthyroidism and diabetes mellitus should be ruled out in cats presenting
with liver enzyme elevations prior to performing more invasive diagnostic procedures such as
liver aspirate or biopsy. In Rover’s case, a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism was confirmed with a
total T4 of 9 µg/dl (normal is <2.5).


Liver enzyme elevations in hyperthyroid cats are most often reversible with control of their
disease. The cause for the elevations is not clear, however malnutrition, cardiac
complications, and direct toxic effects of thyroid hormone may be factors. Histologic lesions
are generally mild and include fatty infiltration and hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis.
There is some evidence that bone ALP contributes to the increased ALP in hyperthyroid cats.


Rover’s hyperthyroidism was well controlled on a low dose of methimazole. His laboratory
work was closely monitored over the first few months of therapy because of the possibility of
hematologic side effects of the drug and because resolution of the hyperthyroidism can
reveal previously subclinical renal insufficiency in some patients. Rover did not experience any
reactions to the methimazole, nor did he develop azotemia, but his liver enzyme values
normalized.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: There is a mild leukopenia with lymphopenia and toxic changes in neutrophils.
Corticosteroid effects could contribute to the lymphopenia, however other elements of the
corticosteroid leukogram such as a neutrophilia and monocytosis are not evident. Toxic
change in the neutrophils suggests an inflammatory process. Due to the acute presentation
of the patient, further abnormalities of the CBC are expected to develop and a follow up
CBC should be collected in the next 24 hours, or sooner if the clinical condition deteriorates.


Platelets: The mild thrombocytopenia is not of the severity that would be expected to result
in spontaneous bleeding in the absence of platelet functional defects. Liver disease and/or a
septic focus could contribute to the decreased platelet count and the mechanism is likely
consumptive. Coagulation studies would help rule out the possibility of disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC).


Serum Biochemical Profile
Mild Azotemia: A prerenal cause of the mild azotemia is suspected based on the clinical
history, the absence of other abnormalities corroborating a primary renal problem (e.g.
normal phosphorus, amylase, and hematocrit), and the suggestion of poor perfusion
(prolonged CRT) and dehydration (albumin at the high end of the reference range). A
concentrated urine specific gravity would help substantiate this interpretation, but a sample
could not be obtained on this patient.


Marked elevation of ALT and AST: There is evidence for significant hepatocellular damage
with hepatocellular enzyme elevations of approximately 100x the upper limit of the reference
interval for both enzymes. Elevation of AST is less specific for liver and could indicate some
muscle damage. A CK might help distinguish the source of the AST but is not clinically
necessary in this case. Unfortunately, these enzyme elevations do not reveal the underlying
cause of the hepatocellular damage, nor are they prognostic.
