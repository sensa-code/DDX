The fluid contains numerous erythrocytes and nucleated cells.
Neutrophils predominate and rare neutrophils appear degenerate.
Some neutrophils contain intracellular debris, although bacteria are not
readily apparent. Rare, small plant fibers are seen along the feathered
edge (Figure 7-3).

###### **Interpretation**

Day 1
No CBC was performed. Serum biochemical changes are mild. The slight hypermagnesemia
may be due to a pre-renal decrease in glomerular filtration rate associated with dehydration.
However, other evidence of dehydration such as azotemia is lacking. The increased bilirubin
is mostly likely due to anorexia given the normal ALP and GGT, while the elevated AST and
CK suggest muscle damage incurred during transport or treatment (intramuscular injections,
etc). The abdominal fluid analysis was within normal limits.


Day 4
CBC: The neutropenia, mild toxic change (Döhle bodies), and hyperfibrinogenemia are
compatible with acute inflammation or endotoxemia. This is most likely related to the
inflammatory exudate in the abdomen. The lymphopenia may reflect corticosteroid effects.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: The hyperglycemia in this case is related to stress, supported by the
lymphopenia.


Hypermagnesemia: This may be due to decreased glomerular filtration rate secondary to
dehydration or circulatory impairment. There is no azotemia present and a urine specific
gravity would be useful in interpretation of these findings.


Hyperproteinemia: The increase in protein is due to an increase in globulins, secondary to
inflammation.


Hypernatremia, hyperchloremia: Increased intake of sodium and chloride via diet or fluid
therapy is a rare cause of hypernatremia and hyperchloremia. Likewise, hyperadrenocorticism/hyperaldosteronism can cause excessive retention of these electrolytes but are
uncommon. Increased sodium and chloride are more often associated with disproportionate
losses of water compared to electrolytes via the kidney, gut, or skin. Restriction of water
intake may also be a factor, as could replacement of hypotonic fluid losses with isotonic fluid.
“Delaney may be experiencing both decreased postsurgical fluid intake as well as hypotonic
fluid loss into the gastrointestinal tract, especially if there is ileus with reflux following
surgery.”


Hyperkalemia: Excessive fluid losses could combine with decreased urinary excretion of
potassium to cause hyperkalemia. At this time, Delaney is not azotemic, so impaired renal
excretion is less likely. Altered acid/base balance can also impact cellular translocation of
potassium, however the HCO3 and anion gap are not abnormal at this time. Intracellular
potassium can also be released with tissue damage. A small to moderate amount of damage
is likely based on the increase in AST and CK, but this is not likely to significantly impact the
serum potassium levels.


Increased AST and CK: This combination of enzymes indicates muscle damage. The
increases over that seen on the first day may be secondary to tissue trauma from surgery or
additional medical procedures such as intramuscular injections. Poor perfusion associated
with sepsis could also contribute to muscle damage.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Delaney’s septic abdomen was treated by placement of indwelling abdominal drains and
serial abdominal lavages. Later, both jugular veins developed thromboses and Delaney’s


abdominal incisions became infected. Despite these complications, her serum biochemical
profiles normalized and she responded well to treatment. She was discharged on antibiotic
therapy and with a wound care plan to complete her recovery at home.


Delaney experienced loss of water in excess of electrolytes, leading to increased serum
electrolyte concentrations. Replacement of this water with appropriate intravenous fluids or
even just increased oral water intake can correct the imbalances. Sometimes water loss alone
or even restricted access to water leads to increased serum electrolytes (See Chapter 5, Case
1). Delaney can be compared with previous cases (6, 7) in which the relative losses of water
and electrolytes were reversed and excess water was consumed or retained. This illustrates
the importance of considering water balance in addition to electrolyte balance when
interpreting serum electrolyte data.


Case 9 – Level 2
“Humphrey” is a 16-year-old neutered male domestic short hair cat presenting for lethargy.
Four days ago, he vomited a large hairball. The following day, he ate and drank, but vomited
three times. For the last 2 days, he has not been eating except for a small amount of baby
food and he has become recumbant. On physical examination, Humphrey has normal
auscultation and a tense abdomen. An oral examination is not possible because Humphrey
wants to bite.

###### **Interpretation**

A CBC was not done.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia with isosthenurina: Failure to concentrate urine in an animal with increased BUN
and creatinine is compatible with renal azotemia. Although the hydration status was not
specifically evaluated, Humphrey’s azotemia may be complicated by pre-renal factors.


Hyperphosphatemia: This is most likely due to decreased glomerular filtration rate resulting
in failure of the kidney to eliminate phosphorus.


Hypoproteinemia: Serum albumin and globulin are within the reference intervals, however,
they are both at the lower end of normal resulting in a lower total protein. Because the serum
albumin is at the lower limit of the reference interval, decreased production or increased
losses of albumin are possible. Although the dipstick evaluation of protein in the urine was
negative, further evaluation of the dilute urine by performing a urine protein:creatinine ratio
would be more sensitive. Decreased liver function also may result in decreased production of
albumin, but additional tests would be needed to evaluate this possibility. Failure to eliminate
water may dilute proteins. These values should be monitored.


Hyponatremia and hypochloremia with normal HCO3: The decrease in chloride is slightly
greater than that of sodium. Because decreased intake of these electrolytes rarely results in
low serum values, the diagnostic focus is on increased losses, including gastrointestinal, renal,
third space, and cutaneous. Humphrey’s damaged kidneys likely cannot regulate sodium
balance, which could lead to increased renal losses. This could be quantified by performing a
urinary fractional excretion of sodium. Disproportional losses of chloride may be related to
acid/base abnormalities, however the serum bicarbonate is currently within the reference
intervals. Blood gas analysis is needed to uncover a mixed acid/base abnormality when the
chloride and bicarbonate do not vary inversely as they typically do.


Hyperkalemia: Polyuric renal failure is often associated with hypokalemia, because the renal
tubular flow rate of remaining functional nephrons is high, promoting kaliuresis. In contrast,
anuric/oliguric renal failure is often accompanied by hyperkalemia because of low single
nephron glomerular filtration rate. Oversupplementation is another cause of hyperkalemia, as
is cellular translocation associated with profound tissue trauma, both of which are unlikely in
this case.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Humphrey was treated with intravenous fluids and gastroprotectants. Despite therapy, his
laboratory abnormalities did not improve, and he produced progressively smaller amounts of
urine over time. Because of his poor response to therapy and the likely chronic and
irreversible nature of his disease, Humphrey was euthanized. At necropsy, Humphrey’s tissues
were diffusely edematous, suggesting fluid retention and the inability of his kidneys to
eliminate a fluid load. Tubulointerstitial nephritis, fibrosis, and mineralization were evident in
both kidneys. The lesions were worse in the right kidney, which had severe degeneration of
remaining tubules. The cause of the renal failure could not be determined due to the chronic
nature of the lesions.


Electrolyte abnormalities associated with renal disease may be quite variable depending on
fluid and food intake, use of medications, other concurrent disease processes, and the stage
of renal failure (polyuric vs. oliguric/anuric). Although not emphasized in this book, many
animals with chronic renal disease who are eating well and have access to water will have


normal serum electrolyte levels. Obstruction of urine flow, uroabdomen, or anuric renal
failure are often associated with hyperkalemia (Chapter 5, Cases 7, 9, 18). In contrast,
patients with polyuric renal failure are predisposed to hypokalemia, particularly if they are
anorexic (Chapter 5, Case 10) or have concurrent third space or gastrointestinal losses
(Chapter 5, Case 11, 20). Marked and potentially dangerous fluctuations in serum potassium
may occur in renal failure patients that undergo rapid changes in glomerular filtration rates
associated with relief of severe dehydration or urinary blockage. Alterations in serum sodium
and chloride with renal failure are somewhat less predictable than potassium and reflect
changes in these electrolytes relative to water. Note that because of fluctuations in water as
well as electrolytes and the potential for cellular translocation, serum electrolytes values are
not reliable indicators of total body electrolyte stores. Damaged kidneys may be somewhat
less able to excrete a sodium load, or to conserve sodium (Chapter 5, Cases 15, 17, 19).


Note that the pattern of hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and hyperkalemia was present in a
patient with abdominal effusion (Serengeti, Chapter 7, Case 3), and could be compatible with
hypoadrenocorticism. Because patients with adrenal insufficiency often have azotemia and
poorly concentrated urine for their degree of dehydration (See Chapter 5, Case 23 and
Astra, Chapter 7, Case 13), it may be very difficult to distinguish renal failure from hypoadrenocorticism based on electrolyte abnormalities alone. In Humphrey’s case, age and species
prioritized renal disease over an endocrinopathy.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Darla is lymphopenic, which suggests corticosteroid effects, although there is no
mature neutrophilia or monocytosis. Lymphopenia is one of the most consistent features of
the corticosteroid leukogram, while other characteristic changes are not always present.
Decreased lymphocyte counts may also be the result of viral mediated lysis or loss via the
gastrointestinal tract.


The hematocrit is low normal, while the red blood cell count and hemoglobin are decreased.
Darla has evidence of hemorrhage including hematuria and hypoproteinemia, as well as
clinical signs which could be related to anemia such as weakness, tachycardia, and tachypnea.
Therefore, even though her hematocrit is within the reference interval, it may not be
“normal”. Although baseline data was not available for Darla, a rapid drop in hematocrit
from the upper end of the reference interval to the lower end could have significant
physiological effects. While clinical signs may be related to the degree of anemia, they also
reflect the rate of decrease in erythrocyte mass. Also, keep in mind that following acute
hemorrhage, it may take up to 24 hours to manifest the full decrease in PCV and total
protein as these occur subsequent to replacement of intravascular volume by internal fluid
shifts, renal conservation of water, and drinking.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypocalcemia: Hypocalcemia with normophosphatemia may be associated with hypoalbuminemia, which is present in this case. Darla is spayed, so pregnancy and lactation are not
affecting calcium metabolism, nor is there evidence of pancreatic or gastrointestinal disease.
