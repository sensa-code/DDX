###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: The leukograms on both days 1 and 5 are characterized by a mild, mature
neutrophilic leukocytosis and mild mature lymphocytosis. Potential causes of these changes
include a stress leukogram, with corticosteroid effects contributing to the neutrophilia and
excitement (epinephrine) causing the lymphocytosis. Mild inflammation is also possible,
however there is no morphologic evidence of toxic change or left shift of the neutrophils.
Antigenic stimulation also may promote lymphocytosis.


Erythrogram: On day 5, there is a moderate normocytic normochromic anemia. The
significant decrease in hematocrit over 5 days suggests loss of red blood cells. Hemorrhage
is possible and supported by the low albumin and globulins, however there is no clinical
evidence of bleeding. Hemolysis is possible, and is supported by the icteric plasma, however
the plasma was icteric prior to the development of anemia and may be related to anorexia or
liver disease. Red blood cell morphology is normal and does not provide additional
information as to the possible causes of red blood cell losses. Unfortunately, because horses
do not release immature erythrocytes into the circulation, a reticulocyte count cannot be
used to determine if there is a regenerative response. The increase in MCV over time
supports regeneration.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: The most common cause of hypoglycemia is failure to process the sample
appropriately, leading to utilization of glucose by cells in the blood sample. Therefore, it is
always appropriate to verify hypoglycemia by drawing another sample with careful attention
to sample handling. A sample should be spun and the serum obtained as soon as the clot
forms, to avoid glucose utilization by blood cells. Drawing the sample into a tube containing
sodium fluoride may also be used to prevent glucose consumption. There are many other
less common causes of hypoglycemia. Decreased liver function is a possible, but rare cause
of hypoglycemia, however, it is compatible with other laboratory data for this patient that
suggest liver disease. The patient is anorectic, however the adequate body condition does
not support starvation as a cause for hypoglycemia, which is unusual even with profoundly
low food intake (See Chapter 6, Case 16). Tumors that produce either insulin (insulinoma) or,
more commonly, insulin-like growth factors also may be associated with hypoglycemia. The
age of the patient makes paraneoplastic hypoglycemia very unlikely. Sepsis is another
potential cause for hypoglycemia, however the leukogram is more compatible with mild
compensated inflammation than sepsis.


Decreased BUN: The most likely cause of low BUN in this patient is decreased liver function.
Other causes could include starvation, polyuria, and overhydration.


Panhypoproteinemia with slightly elevated A:G ratio: Decreased production of albumin
due to liver failure is supported by other findings on the serum biochemical profile and the
concurrent coagulopathy. Other causes are decreased production secondary to starvation,
however this is unlikely with a normal body condition. Increased loss of protein, primarily by
hemorrhage or gastrointestinal losses, is also a good possibility because of approximately
equal losses of albumin and globulins by Day 5.


The possibility of hemorrhage as a cause for protein loss is supported by the anemia seen on
Day 5. Although there is no history of diarrhea, the patient should be tested for
endoparasites as well as ectoparasites. Renal protein loss seems less likely because globulin
proteins often remain within reference interval in patients with protein losing nephropathy.
However, proteinuria was noted on the urinalysis, and a urine protein/creatinine ratio should
be determined to clarify potential renal losses of protein. Confirmation of proteinuria is
especially important because heme proteins may falsely increase urine protein measurement
by dipstick methods.


Decreased HCO3: Low bicarbonate indicates acidemia, but blood gas analysis is required for
complete evaluation. Given the clinical information, acidemia may be due to lactic acidosis
secondary to perfusion deficits and hypoxia/anemia could contribute. Typically, an acidemia
caused by accumulation of lactic acid should increase the anion gap, since lactic acid is an
unmeasured anion. In this case, the low albumin may lower the anion gap. The sum of the
increase in anion gap due to lactic acidosis and the decrease in anion gap due to the hypoalbuminemia may result in a normal value. This is a good illustration of how multiple
abnormalities may combine to produce an analyte value that falls within the reference interval.


Marked direct and indirect hyperbilirubinemia: Anorexia in horses will cause an increase in
the indirect bilirubin of up to 6-8 mg/dl. The anemia in this horse on day 5 indicates that
hemolysis also could contribute to increased bilirubin. This horse also has strong evidence for
liver disease, including decreased liver function, which will cause increases in both direct and
indirect bilirubin.


Increased ALP and GGT (4-5x): Hepatobiliary disease will cause increased ALP and GGT in
horses. Rapid bone growth in young animals may contribute to increased ALP, however in
this patient liver disease is the more likely cause.


Increased AST, LDH, and SDH: Hepatocellular damage will cause elevations in all of these
enzymes, however AST and LDH may be nonspecific and muscle damage will contribute to
increases as well. In this case, the CK is initially within the reference interval until the patient
develops significant anemia. It seems likely therefore, that at least on day 1, the increased
AST is due to liver damage.


Hyperammonemia: Increased blood ammonia indicates decreased liver function, or rarely,
urea cycle disorders.


Urinalysis: The brown color of the urine and the 3+ Heme reaction is compatible with
hemoglobinuria secondary to intravascular hemolysis, although hematuria and myoglobinuria
can produce similar results. Hemolysis is suspected because numbers of red blood cells in the
sediment appear low for the intensity of the heme reaction. Red cells can occasionally lyse in
vitro. The presence of bilirubin crystals indicates bilirubinuria secondary to extravascular
hemolysis and/or liver disease. Aciduria may be attributable to anorexia and metabolic
acidosis. In this case, the urine is somewhat concentrated, with a specific gravity of 1.026.
Liver failure may lead to suboptimal urinary concentrating ability because of lack of urea for
generation of gradient for concentration, among other mechanisms. The presence of
pigments in the urine may interfere with colorimetric assessment of glucose in the urine,
resulting in a false positive.


Coagulation panel: Marked prolongation of the PT and APTT indicate a secondary
hemostatic defect of both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways or the common pathway. This
is compatible with markedly decreased liver function. Disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC) is a differential diagnosis, however platelet numbers are within the reference interval,
and FDP’s are not elevated. Fibrinogen (100 mg/dl) might be low due to impaired synthesis
secondary to liver dysfunction. Low fibrinogen is less often a feature of DIC in large animals
compared to small animals because of the capacity of domestic large animal species to
produce abundant fibrinogen. The history was negative for exposure to warfarin-type
anticoagulants, which may produce similar prolongation of the PT and APTT.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Decreased liver function with evidence of hepatocellular damage and cholestasis.
Possible hemolytic anemia secondary to liver failure, or hemorrhage related to a
coagulapathy resulting from liver disease.


On day 6 of hospitalization, the colt began moaning, lying down, and looking at his flanks,
although gut sounds were normal. He continued to pass red-brown urine, and his PCV
dropped to 10%. Later that day he developed epistaxis. His coagulation parameters
normalized after transfusions of blood and fresh frozen plasma, and no further bleeding was
noted. The next day he became more obtunded and ataxic, developed ventral edema, and
had a precipitous fall in his PCV. He was euthanized due to lack of response to therapy and
poor prognosis. At necropsy, the foal’s liver was small, and histologic examination revealed
severe portal and midzonal chronic active necrotizing hepatitis with intrahepatic cholestasis.
Grossly, the kidneys showed green/brown discoloration. Histologically, there was moderate
multifocal, subacute tubular necrosis and pigmented granular casts, compatible with
hemoglobin nephropathy.


The cause of the liver disease in Flower was never confirmed, however potential differentials
should include infectious disease such as Tyzzer’s disease, immune-mediated disease such as
Theiler’s disease (although unlikely in this young animal), exposure to hepatotoxins, or a
congenital hepatopathy. This foal was related to the foals reported to have Morgan foal
hepatopathy (McConnico), a congenital liver disease analogous to hyperammonemia-hyperornithinemia-homocitrullinuria syndrome in people.


This case should be compared with Stella (Case 15), who also had concurrent hemolysis and
liver disease. In both these cases, the combination of anorexia, liver disease, and severe
hemolysis complicated the interpretation of the laboratory work. These cases are in contrast
to Skipper (Case 16), whose laboratory abnormalities were more easily attributable to liver
disease because of her normal hemogram.


Severe acute anemia will often cause hepatocellular damage secondary to poor oxygenation
of tissues. As seen with both this foal and Stella, muscle tissue may also suffer hypoxic
damage. Therefore, it may be difficult to interpret the elevation of enzymes that occur in
both tissues, such as AST and LDH. The Heinz bodies present in Stella’s blood suggested a
mechanism for the hemolysis. For Flower, the normal red blood cell morphology made it
more difficult to determine the cause for the anemia. No agglutination was observed to
suggest immune-mediated mechanisms, although a Coomb’s test was not performed. Red
blood cell parasites were not detected on microscopic examination of blood films. The
brown urine suggested intravascular hemolysis, but a cause could not be found. The
presumptive cause for hemolysis in this patient was liver failure, however hemolysis was not
described in the Morgan foal hepatopathy report. A hemolytic syndrome associated with
increased erythrocyte fragility has been described as a near terminal event in horses with
severe liver failure.

Liver Case 18 – Level 2
“Hilda” is a 10-year-old spayed female Doberman presenting for lethargy, vomiting, and
anorexia. She had a gastric dilatation volvulus 3 months ago and has been on carprofen for
arthritis for the past 2 years. She has also been on phenylpropanolamine for urinary
incontinence and is a carrier for the von Willebrands trait. Hilda has been anorectic for
several days. She will drink water, though she vomits it up afterwards. She has become
progressively more lethargic to the point of not rising more than once a day. She has watery
diarrhea once a day. The dog frequently receives high fat treats such as Danish pastries,
cheesecake, bread and butter, and cat food.


On physical examination, Hilda is dull and lethargic with sunken eyes. She has mild
conjunctivitis, and her sclera are yellow. Auscultation is within normal limits, and her capillary
refill time is less than two seconds. Temperature, pulse and respirations are normal. She has
several large lipomatous masses.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: Hilda has a mild mature neutrophilia with lymphopenia, possibly due to
corticosteroid effects. Mild inflammation cannot be ruled out.


Platelets: If no clumps are seen, there may be thrombocytopenia. An automated or manual
count should be performed to quantitate platelet numbers.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Marked azotemia with hyperphosphatemia: These values suggest decreased glomerular
filtration rate. In combination with the isosthenuric urine, the azotemia can be classified as
renal. A prerenal component secondary to dehydration may exacerbate the renal azotemia.


Hypochloremia: The history indicates that chloride could be lost via vomiting of gastric
contents. Acid/base abnormalities also may contribute to hypochloremia, however the HCO3
is within the reference interval for this patient. Arterial blood gas is required for full
evaluation of acid/base disturbances.


Increased anion gap: A likely source of unmeasured anions in this patient could be uremic
acids. Lactic acidosis may occur in dehydrated patients with impaired tissue perfusion.


Hyperbilirubinemia: In the absence of anemia or other evidence for significant hemolysis and
given the liver enzyme elevations, cholestasis is the cause for the hyperbilirubinemia.


Increased ALP (13-15x): If there is no apparent cause for enzyme induction, increased ALP is
interpreted as evidence for cholestasis. The GGT is at the upper limit of the reference range
and should be monitored for increases.


Increased ALT and AST (2x and 6x): Hepatocellular damage is occurring concurrently with
cholestasis and could be secondary to the damaging effects of bile on the hepatocytes.


Increased amylase and lipase: Given the history of vomiting and diarrhea along with a high
fat diet, pancreatitis is possible. Clinicians should be aware, however, that decreased
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can result in increased amylase and lipase. Generally,
decreased GFR will cause relatively minor elevations in pancreatic enzymes, often 2-4x the
upper limit of the reference range.


###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Renal azotemia with cholestasis and hepatocellular damage, possible pancreatitis
