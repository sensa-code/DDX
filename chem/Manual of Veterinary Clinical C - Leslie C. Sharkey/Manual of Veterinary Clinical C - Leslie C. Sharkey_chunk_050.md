###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Bear was treated with calcium and Vitamin D supplementation, which increased his ionized
calcium levels and improved his clinical signs. His PTH levels were low at 1.5 pmol/L
(reference interval = 2-13), supporting the diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism.
Hypoparathyroidism may follow injury of the parathyroid glands during surgical procedures in
the neck or may be secondary to immune-mediated destruction of the gland.


Case 4 – Level 1
“Lolita” is a 2-year-old Standardbred mare. During exercise the day before, she broke away
from the trainer. After exercise this morning, she began to show signs of tying up including
pain, colic, stiffness, a shuffling hindlimb gait, and sweating. She continued to sweat
profusely and by 1.5 hr post exercise, she had dark urine (Figure 6-1). The referring
veterinarian gave her banamine and xylazine for the trip to the referral hospital. Lolita
presented with profuse sweating, synchronous diaphragmatic flutter, and dark urine. She had
a history of a similar episode of tying up last year.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: No abnormalities


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperphosphatemia: Acute rhabdomyolysis is associated with hyperphosphatemia. The
marked elevations in AST and CK and the discolored urine (probably myoglobin) support
muscle damage and translocation of phosphorus outside of cells as the most likely cause for
the increased phosphorus. Other common causes of increased serum phosphorus include
skeletal growth in immature horses, endurance exercise, and renal failure, none of which are
consistent with the clinical history or other laboratory data (the patient has concentrated
urine and is not azotemic). Less commonly, Vitamin D toxicity will result in hyperphosphatemia.


Normal total calcium with slightly low ionized calcium: Hyperphosphatemia leads to a
compensatory decrease in ionized calcium because of mass law interactions and because of
decreased active Vitamin D synthesis by the kidney. As has been described in other cases, a
discrepancy between total calcium and ionized calcium is present in this case and illustrates
the rationale for measurement of the biologically active fraction of the mineral in some
situations.


Low ionized magnesium: The serum ionized magnesium concentration in this patient is
minimally depressed and may not be clinically significant at this time. The history of sweating
indicates potential route for loss of magnesium via the skin, although decreased gastrointestinal absorption, increased gastrointestinal losses or renal wasting are possible.


Increased HCO3: In general, this value is interpreted as evidence of alkalosis, however the
normal blood gas results make this unlikely. Artfactual elevations of HCO3 have been
reported in two horses and a calf with severe muscle disease (Collins) as a result of
interference with the enzymatic method for detection of bicarbonate by LDH released from
the injured muscle. The original report also described increased anion gaps, which was not
noted in Lolita. LDH was not reported in Lolita, however her serum sample was run on a
Hitachi analyzer similar to the chemistry analyzer in the report by Collins et al. By day 3,
Lolita has a mild acidemia with elevated anion gap, which could be the result of lactic
acidosis or accumulation of another unmeasured anion.


Hyperbilirubinemia: In horses, anorexia should always be considered as a cause of hyperbilirubinemia. The concurrently elevated GGT indicates that cholestasis is another potential
contributor to increased serum bilirubin. Hemolysis may also cause hyperbilirubinemia,
however Lolita is not initially anemic when she presents with elevated bilirubin. Her PCV does
drop significantly over 2 days (although it remains within the reference interval) with no


additional change in serum bilirubin. Some of this decrement in packed cell volume may be
attributable to rehydration/fluid therapy. It is also possible that her initial PCV was increased
due to splenic contraction secondary to excitement of transport and pain.


Increased GGT: Elevations in GGT are compatible with cholestasis, which may be primary or
secondary to hypoxia, gastrointestinal disease, sepsis, or other processes. Enzyme elevations
are not specific as to etiology, however the trend back towards the upper limit of the reference
interval indicates that a complete work up for primary liver disease does not need to be
pursued unless other clinical signs or laboratory abnormalities indicative of liver disease appear.


Marked increases in AST and CK: The combination of these abnormalities is supportive of
rhabdomyolysis, consistent with the clinical impression of tying up. As with liver enzymes,
elevations in muscle enzymes are not specific as to etiology, and many patients with a history
of trauma, strenuous exercise, trembling, or intramuscular injections may have increased CK.
Conversely, some types of muscle disease do not cause increased CK or AST. The short halflife of creatine kinase explains the precipitous drop in CK by Day 3 while AST levels remain
increased.


Urinalysis: The dark brown urine collected on Day 1 is consistent with the presence of either
blood, hemoglobin, myoglobin, or bilirubin. Although the information is not available for this
patient, examination of the urine for the presence of erythrocytes will rule in or out
hematuria as a cause for the discoloration. The normal plasma color with dark urine is
suggests myoglobinuria because myoglobin is not significantly protein bound in the plasma
and is therefore rapidly cleared in the kidney. Hemoglobinuria is generally associated with
hemoglobinemia, which will cause pink to red discoloration of the plasma. Occasionally
erythrocytes will lyse in urine, leading to a negative sediment examination and the impression
of hemoglobinuria instead of hematuria. An ammonium sulfate test or protein electrophoresis
will confirm the presence of myoglobin. Myoglobin will cause protein, bilirubin, and heme
test strips to be positive.


On presentation, the urine appears adequately concentrated and fluid therapy is likely
causing the production of more dilute urine on day 3. Pigments such as hemoglobin and
myoglobin may have toxic effects on the kidney, so the patient should be monitored for
isosthenuria and azotemia as signs of nephropathy. This is especially true in this patient
because of the presence of casts, which can be a sign of renal damage. Unfortunately, the
type and number of casts were not described. Small numbers of hyaline casts may merely
reflect diuresis and correction of dehydration, while large numbers of cellular casts can
indicate renal tubular cell degeneration and necrosis. The absence of casts in the second
sample does not rule out kidney damage.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

For 4 days, Lolita was treated with lactated ringers supplemented with calcium and
magnesium, banamine [®], and vitamin E. She was sent home with instructions to hand walk her
for 2 weeks, followed by light exercise. Dietary changes also were recommended. A muscle
biopsy was suggested as a follow up to assess the potential for polysaccharide storage
myopathy, which is documented in Quarter horses and is compatible with her clinical signs
and laboratory data.

Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypercalcemia with low normal phosphorus: In an older patient, a primary consideration for
the combination of high serum calcium with normal to low phosphorus is neoplasia. Although
many tumors have been documented to cause hypercalcemia of malignancy in small animal
patients, hematopoietic neoplasia, anal sac apocrine gland adenocarcinoma, and parathyroid
tumors should be primary differential diagnoses. Further diagnostic procedures may include
imaging studies to detect masses or enlarged organs, cytologic or histologic examination of
affected tissues, and/or measurement of PTH and PTHrP. In this case, the liver should be
evaluated because of the enzyme elevations. Hypoadrenocorticism can also mildly elevate
serum calcium. However this condition is less likely given Carley’s history of steroid
treatment, lack of appropriate clinical signs, and lack of significant electrolyte abnormalities.


Hyperbilirubinemia with increased ALP, GGT, and cholesterol: The elevated ALP, GGT, and
cholesterol are compatible with the presence of cholestasis as a cause for elevated serum
bilirubin. Hemolysis can also contribute to hyperbilirubinemia, however Carley is not anemic,
nor does she have any morphologic abnormalities of erythrocytes that would suggest
increased red blood cell destruction. Decreased liver function or sepsis can also contribute to
mild elevations in serum bilirubin. Sepsis is unlikely with a normal leukogram. Liver enzyme
values do not predict liver function, and liver function is best evaluated by measuring serum
bile acids or blood ammonia. Other evidence of severe liver dysfunction, such as hypoalbuminemia, low BUN, and hypocholesterolemia are absent in this profile. Therapy with corticosteroids can induce ALP and GGT and, in some cases, can produce a steroid hepatopathy. A
variety of endocrinopathies and metabolic derangements also can increase ALP, GGT, and
cholesterol, however they appear less likely than the problems described above.


Increased ALT and AST: Elevations in these enzymes support the presence of damage to
hepatocytes, but do not specify cause. Potential causes for hepatocellular damage in this
patient include cholestasis and steroid hepatopathy, although the hypercalcemia indicates
that neoplasia should evaluated as a cause of liver injury.


Urinalysis: The significance of the low urine specific gravity is uncertain in a patient that is
not azotemic or dehydrated. Normal urine specific gravity can vary considerably in healthy
patients, however hypercalcemia can interfere with urinary concentrating ability via several
different mechanisms and may be an issue here (See Chapter 5, Case 4). Pre-renal azotemia
may develop if water intake cannot compensate for ongoing losses and laboratory work may
be indistinguishable from renal failure. In addition, liver disease may also be associated with
polyuria and polydipsia (See Chapter 5, Case 12). Treatment with corticosteroids may
contribute to poor urinary concentrating ability.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Abdominal ultrasound revealed a markedly enlarged gall bladder compatible with a mucocele,
so Carley went to surgery for gall bladder removal and examination of the abdomen for
evidence of neoplasia. At surgery, biopsy material was collected from the liver and duodenum,
however all other structures appeared grossly normal and were not sampled. Histologically,
the liver had evidence of steroid hepatopathy, the gall bladder showed glandular hyperplasia
with hypersecretion of mucus, and the duodenum had congestion and lymphoplasmacytic
enteritis. There was no evidence of neoplasia in any of the biopsy sections.


Carley recovered well from surgery, and her serum biochemical abnormalities normalized,
with the exception of the hypercalcemia, which was persistent over the next several weeks
and remained in the range of 12-13 mg/dl. In addition, the phosphorus level dropped to
1.3 mg/dl (2.6-7.2). At this point, ultrasound examination of the neck revealed a small mass in
the region of the right parathyroid gland. Carley had another surgery to remove the mass,
which was an expansive but non-invasive parathyroid adenoma characterized by uniform cells
with low mitotic activity and proliferating in solid sheets. PTH and PTHrP levels were not
measured since a parathyroid mass was located using ultrasound.


Case 6 – Level 2
“Picasso” is a 12-year-old intact male Weimeraner presenting for non-painful lumps on his
head that the owners noticed two months ago. On physical examination, Picasso’s teeth are
movable but do not appear painful. Skull radiographs reveal severe bone demineralization in
the maxilla and mandible (Figure 6-2A and B).
