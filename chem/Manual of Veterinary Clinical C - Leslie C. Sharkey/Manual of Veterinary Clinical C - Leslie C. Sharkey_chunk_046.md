This and several other cases in this chapter underscore the impact of metabolic
derangements unrelated to renal disease on serum BUN and creatinine. Gerhardt had
decreases in BUN likely related to osmotic diuresis and polyuria. Decreased BUN and
creatinine were noted in Case 3, Marsali, who presented for starvation related to neglect.
Pugsley, Case 12, presented with decreased BUN and creatinine related to a portosystemic
shunt, while Riff Raff, Case 8, had elevated BUN because of a septic process.

Case 23 – Level 3
“Miranda” is a 6-year-old spayed female Newfoundland dog presenting for weakness,
lethargy, and vomiting. She has become progressively more lethargic and anorexic for the
last few days, and the owners also noted shaking. Miranda collapsed on presentation and
was reluctant to walk. On physical examination, Miranda’s mucous membranes were tacky,
and she was bradycardic with weak femoral pulses and prolonged capillary refill time.
Because of her episode of collapse, fluids were administered immediately after drawing
blood for diagnostic testing.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Polycythemia is relative and attributable to dehydration. This interpretation is
supported by the tacky mucous membranes and hyperproteinemia.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: Processing errors should be ruled out in all cases of hypoglycemia, however
the episode of collapse and history of shaking suggests that the change may not be
artifactual. Although she has been anorexic, hypoglycemia associated with starvation
generally requires prolonged food deprivation and poor body condition. Various types of
neoplasia can cause low blood glucose levels and are possible in a middle aged large breed
dog. Failure of gluconeogenesis because of poor liver function can cause hypoglycemia. This
appears unlikely because of the high BUN, high albumin, and normal cholesterol, but specific
tests of liver function such as serum bile acids or blood ammonia could be considered to
further evaluate this possibility. The shaking and collapse could be related to hepatic
encephalopathy. Finally, patients with hypoadrenocorticism may have hypoglycemia due to
failure of corticosteroid stimulated gluconeogenesis.


Azotemia: Miranda’s poorly concentrated urine in the context of significant dehydration
suggests the possibility of a renal cause for the azotemia, although there is certainly a prerenal component given the dehydration and bradycardia with poor femoral pulses. Low
glomerular filtration rate is supported by the hyperphosphatemia and hyperkalemia. Before
renal azotemia can be confirmed, other non-renal causes of poor urinary concentrating ability
should be considered, including liver failure (unlikely, see above), osmotic diuresis (detectable
osmoles such as glucose and ketones are not present in the urine), diuretic usage (none in
this history), and medullary washout, which is possible given the hyponatremia and
hypochloremia. If medullary washout is the reason for the poorly concentrated urine,
appropriate supplementation and fluid therapy should correct the problem.


Hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcemia: Renal failure, vitamin D toxicity, and hypoadrenocorticism can lead to these changes. Both renal failure and hypoadrenocorticism are
compatible with the other laboratory data and in both, inadequate glomerular filtration rate
for elimination of phosphorus leads to its accumulation in the blood. Hypoadrenocorticism is
a cause of hypercalcemia in dogs, but is not associated with increases in ionized calcium and
is therefore not expected to cause clinical signs related to hypercalcemia. Diminished renal
excretion because of cortisol deficiency and hemoconcentration are potential mechanisms for
the hypercalcemia, and the calcium level normalizes quickly after initiation of therapy. The
most common cause of hypercalcemia in dogs is hypercalcemia of malignancy, which cannot
be ruled out in this case. Hypercalcemia can cause both reversible and irreversible renal
dysfunction, predisposing to the development of hyperphosphatemia. Measurement of PTH
and PTHrP can help differentiate various causes of hypercalcemia, but is not necessary in this
case.


Hypermagnesemia: Decreased glomerular filtration rate is the cause for the high magnesium.


Hyperproteinemia with hyperalbuminemia: Hyperalbuminemia is the result of hemoconcentration. Miranda’s tacky mucous membranes are consistent with dehydration, as is the relative
polycythemia.


Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Increased losses are the most likely cause for Miranda’s
hyponatremia and hypochloremia, which are approximately proportional. Given her history,
gastrointestinal losses are possible. The potential for third space and cutaneous losses should


be evaluated in the context of the clinical information. Renal losses should also be
considered, and can be quantified by performing urinary fractional excretions. Patients with
hyponatremia should have low urinary fractional excretion of sodium as the body attempts to
conserve the electrolyte; normal to increased fractional excretion under these circumstances
would be abnormal and reflect either renal disease or hypoadrenocorticism (lack of
aldosterone to signal the need to conserve sodium in the kidney). Dietary deficiency is rarely
the cause of low sodium and chloride in small animal patients being fed commercial diets.
While accumulation of free water and dilution of these electrolytes is a potential mechanism,
evidence of dehydration, including polycythemia and hyperproteinemia, rule it out.


Hyperkalemia: Polyuric renal failure is often associated with hypokalemia because of enhanced
urinary potassium loss. It is only when glomerular filtration is markedly limited or when urine
cannot be eliminated from the body that hyperkalemia ensues. Miranda has marked
dehydration and clinical evidence of poor perfusion (weak femoral pulses and prolonged
capillary refill time) that could severely reduce glomerular filtration. Her other laboratory
abnormalities are also suggestive for hypoadrenocorticism, which could lead to hyperkalemia
because of aldosterone deficiency. Cellular translocation in response to acidosis is also possible,
however this appears to be less important with organic acidosis than mineral acidosis.


Low HCO3: The acidemia in this case may be related to either uremic acidosis or lactic
acidosis secondary to poor tissue perfusion.


Increased anion gap: As noted above, increased uremic acids or lactic acid could elevate the
anion gap. Because most of the anion gap in health is due to negatively charged proteins,
the hyperalbuminemia could also contribute to increased anion gap.


Increased AST: This most likely reflects tissue damage secondary to poor perfusion.


Increased amylase: The mild change in this value is most compatible with the decreased
glomerular filtration rate, although gastrointestinal disease can also be associated with
increased amylase and is compatible with the clinical history. Pancreatic disease cannot be
ruled out, but is not required to explain this data.


Urinalysis: The pyuria and bactiuria indicate a urinary tract infection.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Miranda’s laboratory data normalized after 2 days of appropriate fluid therapy, but
unfortunately she developed melena with anemia and hypoproteinemia while in the hospital.
Because of the history and laboratory results, an ACTH stimulation test was performed to
evaluate Miranda for hypoadrenocorticism. Both pre and post stimulation cortisol levels were
less than 1.0 µg/dl, consistent with hypoadrenocorticism. Melena and hypoproteinemia are
described in dogs with hypoadrenocorticism. This is the result of hypoperfusion of the gut
due to circulatory collapse and because normal glucocorticoid levels are required for
maintenance of gastrointestinal mucosa. Miranda was given hormone replacement for her
hypoadrenocorticism and was treated with antibiotics for her urinary tract infection. She was
also given anthelmintics because of her signs of gastrointestinal disease. Miranda responded
to treatment and went home.


These clinical signs are common with hypoadrenocorticism, however some types of gastrointestinal parasites can also cause laboratory abnormalities similar to hypoadrenocorticism (see
Chapter 7 for more details). Patients with hypoadrenocorticism may present with laboratory
data suggestive for renal failure (dehydration, azotemia, and inadequately concentrated


urine). Correction of fluid and electrolyte deficits allows the patient to regain urinary
concentrating ability shortly after initiation of therapy, which would be unlikely in a case of
primary renal failure. Such response to treatment should prompt consideration of an ACTH
stimulation test to evaluate adrenal gland function. This case should be compared with Jag,
Case 4, in which hypercalcemia of malignancy also resulted in temporary loss of urinary
concentrating ability that may be unrelated to primary renal pathology, although renal lesions
may eventually develop with hypercalcemia. Liver disease may also interfere with the
production of concentrated urine (See Pugsley, Case 12), although BUN or creatinine may be
low rather than high in these cases.


Case 24 – Level 3
“Popcorn” is a 12-year-old intact female Yorkshire Terrier presenting with polyuria and
polydipsia. On physical examination, Popcorn is depressed, has a vaginal discharge, and
bilateral cataracts. She has tacky mucous membranes and is slightly pale. Because of
Popcorn’s age, the owner requested a thorough workup to rule out neoplasia prior to any
surgical interventions. As a result, a bone marrow and serum protein electrophoresis was
done in addition to routine blood work.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Popcorn has a marked neutrophilic leukocytosis with toxic change and monocytosis,
indicating severe inflammation. There is also a mild normocytic, normochromic anemia, which
is likely nonregenerative, but a reticulocyte count would be needed to confirm this. Anemia of
inflammatory disease is the likely cause of this anemia, however the isosthenuria and azotemia
indicates that renal disease could also be a factor in the development of this anemia.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: If processing errors have been excluded, the leukogram suggests the
possibility of sepsis as a cause of the hypoglycemia. Liver failure and various types of
neoplasia are also possible causes of hypoglycemia in a patient of this age. Starvation can
cause hypoglycemia, particularly in small or very young animals. Hypoalbuminemia could also
be associated with inadequate nutrition, but poor body condition should be observed
clinically, which is not described here.


Azotemia and isosthenuria: This combination of azotemia and an isosthenuric urine in a
dehydrated patient is suggestive for renal failure, but there are exceptions when extra-renal
factors interfere with renal concentrating ability. Neither osmotic diuresis nor medullary
washout appears probable. Liver failure is a consideration given the hypoglycemia and
hypoalbuminemia, however the biliburin and cholesterol are within reference range. While
liver enzymes may be normal in hepatic failure, the normal values in this patient suggest that
liver failure is unlikely. Diabetes insipidus is a potential consideration. Given the clinical
history, Popcorn should be evaluated for a pyometra. Infection of the uterus by _E. coli_ results
in the elaboration of toxins which may cause polyuria by interfering with sodium and chloride
resorption in the loop of Henle and by causing a reversible insensitivity of the tubules to
antidiuretic hormone. In this case renal function should be re-evaluated once the pyometra
has been successfully treated. The azotemia in this case may be entirely reversible if
pyometra is the underlying cause. In any case, the dehydration suggests that there is at least
a pre-renal component to the increased BUN and creatinine.


Hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcemia: The hyperphosphatemia is most likely the result of
decreased glomerular filtration rate, whether due to renal or pre-renal factors. Calcium
changes unpredictably in small animal patients with renal failure, and total calcium may be
