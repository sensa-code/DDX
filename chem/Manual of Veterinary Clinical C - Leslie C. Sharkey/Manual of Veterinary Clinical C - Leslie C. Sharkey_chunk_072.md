Increased CK: This enzyme indicates muscle damage. Muscle damage may occur as a result of
transport or medical procedures such as intramuscular injections. If Albus is painful, he may
self-traumatize and cause muscle damage. Although connective tissue in general is resistant to
the effects of hypoxia, poor perfusion could contribute to muscle damage in some cases.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Tests for rotavirus and _Clostridium perfringens_ were negative. Albus responded to
symptomatic therapy consisting of antiobiotics, fluids and pain medication. Albus may be
compared with Delaney (Chapter 7, Case 8), who had much less complicated laboratory data.
Delaney illustrates gastrointestinal disease in which electrolyte losses are minimal, while free
water loss and restricted access to water lead to hypernatremia and hyperchloremia. In
contrast, Albus is experiencing more significant electrolyte losses along with possible free
water retention or increased intake to compensate for ongoing fluid losses, resulting in
hyponatremia and hypochloremia. Note the low sodium and chloride with high potassium, a
pattern that has been seen several times in the previous cases in this chapter. While Delaney
has no apparent acid/base abnormalities, enteritis and fluid imbalances contribute to the
development of a high anion gap metabolic acidosis in Albus.

Overview
Step 1: If electrolyte levels are high, consider
Increased input through diet or therapeutic interventions (Case 1, and 14)
Decreased elimination, particularly through the kidney (Case 9, 13, 20, and 21)
Cellular translocation, especially for potassium (Case 2, and 17)
Concentration of electrolytes in a smaller volume of fluid (Case 8, and 15)
Electrochemical compensation for acid/base abnormalities


Step 2: If electrolyte levels are low, consider
Decreased input via diet, mostly for potassium (Case 4, and 11)
Electrolyte loss:
Gastrointestinal tract (Case 4, 5, 6, 7, 18, 19, 24, and 25)
Kidneys (Case 9, 13, 18, and 19)
Third space (body cavities, interstitium) (Case 3, 20, 21, and 23)
Cutaneous losses (Case 11, and 21)
Hemorrhage (Case 10, and 24)
Dilution (Case 9, 10, 12, 17, 18, 21, and 22)
Electrochemical compensation for acid/base abnormalities


Step 3: If electrolyte values are normal, but the patient has potential sources of retention or
loss or has abnormalities of fluid or acid/base regulation, consider the possibility that
multiple factors causing opposing abnormalities have cumulatively resulted in a normal value


Step 4: If the patient is alkalotic (high bicarbonate), consider bicarbonate retention, acid
sequestration or depletion (Case 5, 6, 10, 11, 19, and 21)


Step 5: If the patient is acidemic (low bicarbonate), consider loss of bicarbonate or acid
retention (Case 12, 18 and 25)


Step 6: If the patient has an increased anion gap, consider hyperalbuminemia with
dehydration or accumulation of endogenous or exogenous organic acids (Case 6, 12, 17, 18,
20, and 21)


Step 7: If the patient has a decreased anion gap, consider abnormalities of proteins or
cations such as calcium and magnesium (Case 13, 23, and 24)
