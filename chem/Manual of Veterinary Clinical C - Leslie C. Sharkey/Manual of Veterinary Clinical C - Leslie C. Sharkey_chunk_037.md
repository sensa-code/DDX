Azotemia: Azotemia should be categorized as pre-renal, renal, or post-renal. The minimally
concentrated urine supports the possibility of renal dysfunction, however this does not rule
out a pre-renal component to the azotemia if there is clinical evidence of dehydration. The
presence of a large, firm bladder is suspicious, and this cat may have post-renal azotemia
related to urethral blockage.


Hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia: The most likely cause of hyperphosphatemia in this
patient is decreased glomerular filtration rate, regardless of whether the decreased GFR is
due to pre-renal, renal, or post-renal causes. Dogs and cats in renal failure may have high,
normal, or low serum calcium levels, and ionized calcium levels may not correlate with total
calcium levels as they often do in healthy animals. In a small study of cats with urethral
obstruction, 75% had low ionized calcium, and 27% had low total calcium (Drobatz). All cats
with low total calcium also had low ionized calcium. While not directly evaluated, formation
of calcium-phosphorus complexes and impaired PTH activity were suggested as mechanisms.
Renal secondary hyperparathyroidism and primary hypoparathyroidism may also cause hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia. PTH levels will be increased in renal secondary hyperparathyroidism as the body attempts to increase serum calcium that has dropped in response
to the hyperphosphatemia resulting from the low GFR. In contrast, low PTH levels in primary
hypoparathyroidism cannot maintain adequate calcium levels in the blood and fail to
promote the excretion of phosphorus into the urine.


Hypochloremia and normal sodium: Loss of chloride in excess of sodium in the gastrointestinal tract can result in disproportionate hypochloremia, but appropriate clinical signs are
not described in the history. Chronic respiratory acidosis will trigger increased excretion of
chloride by the kidney. Diuretic use can potentiate urinary chloride loss. Because Ringo has
hypochloremia and hyperkalemia, hypoadrenocorticism is a possibility, but is rare in cats.


Hyperkalemia and increased anion gap: Hyperkalemia is associated with renal diseases
characterized by inability to eliminate urine, whether from urethral blockage, uroabdomen, or
oliguric/anuric renal failure. Increased intake or oversupplementation or drug effects are not
compatible with the clinical history, and translocation due to acute inorganic acidosis also
appears unlikely, although the anion gap suggests a metabolic acidosis (probably uremic).
Hypocalcemia may potentiate the effects of hyperkalemia on the heart.


Increased AST: This increase is mild and is not accompanied by an increased ALT. Hemolysis
or muscle damage are possible sources of the increased AST.


Urinalysis: The erythrocytes, heme, and protein are compatible with the presence of blood in
the urine. The urine is not adequately concentrated for a dehydrated patient, which may be
related to tubular dysfunction associated with obstructive nephropathy. This is not necessarily
a permanent change and the urine specific gravity should be re-evaluated after treatment.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Ringo was found to have a urethral obstruction, and after he was sedated, caseous material
was extracted from his urethra. Ringo was treated with intravenous fluids and calcium
gluconate following placement of a urethral catheter. The next day Ringo was bright and
alert, but continued to pass bloody urine. Two days later his catheter was removed and he
continued to pass urine, so he was discharged.


Ringo should be compared with the previous two cases of post-renal azotemia (Chapter 5,
Case 2, Sherpa, and Case 6, Gucci). Those two dogs had relatively slowly developing
obstructions in which imaging studies revealed renal changes, making it more likely that
permanent renal damage occurred with some degree of renal azotemia. Obstructed cats, on
the other hand, are more likely to present acutely and have less severe, if any, renal
parenchymal lesions. Because Ringo was unable to pass urine for a period of time, he
developed hyperkalemia, which was not noted in the two dogs as they were able to continue
to pass some urine, albeit with difficulty.


Ringo’s relatively dilute urine in combination with the azotemia gives the impression of renal
azotemia. Like Gucci (Case 6), temporary tubular dysfunction may be present after relief of
the urinary obstruction. The passage of large amounts of relatively dilute urine characterizes
a period of post-obstructive diuresis after relief of urethral blockage (Nichols). Osmotic
diuresis from elevated urea nitrogen content of the urine may also contribute to postobstructive diuresis. This process is generally self-limiting, however large amounts of fluid can
be lost. The patient must be monitored carefully for electrolyte changes, specifically for
hypokalemia as the metabolic acidosis corrects itself and high tubular flow rates result in
renal potassium loss. As the pressure is relieved and normal water and electrolyte balance is
re-established, urinary concentrating ability generally recovers. This is in contrast to the
apparently permanent loss of urinary concentrating ability noted in Gucci (Case 6).

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Riff Raff has leucopenia with neutropenia and a degenerative left shift. It is not known if
Riff Raff had a left shift prior to the original surgical procedure. However, dogs with a left
shift prior to surgery for intestinal anastomoses are at increased risk for anastomotic leakage
and should be monitored carefully (Ralphs). Riff Raff also has a normocytic normochromic
anemia. The anemia may be nonregenerative, however a reticulocyte count is needed to
make this assessment. His anemia is more severe than is typically due to chronic disease or
inflammation alone, and blood loss from the previous surgery may have contributed to the
decrease in RBC mass. Further blood loss is possible because of Riff Raff’s coagulopathy. The
thrombocytopenia can be explained by disseminated intravascular coagulation (see
coagulation data); however some degree of immune mediated destruction or impaired
production cannot be ruled out. The combination of neutropenia, nonregenerative anemia
and thrombocytopenia could be compatible with a primary bone marrow problem, however
these changes can be accounted for by extramarrow causes and a bone marrow aspirate is
not indicated at this time.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: Given the leukogram, a septic process is the most likely cause of
hypoglycemia, once sample processing errors are ruled out. Inadequate gluconeogenesis as
a result of poor liver function is possible. Impaired liver function is compatible with by the
albumin and cholesterol which are at the lower limits of the reference ranges, the hyperbilirubinemia, and the prolonged PT and APTT. Serum bile acids could be performed to evaluate
this possibility. Small breed dogs may be more likely to develop hypoglycemia with anorexia,
however in most cases anorexia must be severe or prolonged to cause low blood glucose.
Even then, the decrease in glucose is generally mild (see Marsali, Chapter 5, Case 3 and
Chapter 3).


Increased BUN with normal creatinine: Several contributing factors are present to explain
increased BUN with normal creatinine. This may represent early pre-renal azotemia, when
BUN increases because of slow tubular flow rates and increased time for passive reabsorption
of urea. Poor renal perfusion may be the result of dehydration or low blood pressure
secondary to septic shock. Hydration status is difficult to assess using laboratory data
because of the confounding effects of anemia and the possibility of protein losses from
hemorrhage, into the gastrointestinal tract, or into the abdominal effusion. BUN may also
increase if there has been bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract, or as a result of protein
catabolism associated with fever, sepsis, or surgery. A urinalysis is needed to assess renal
concentrating ability.


Hypokalemia: This patient is likely to have been anorexic during the course of his illness, so
decreased intake could lower serum potassium concentration. Increased losses via the
gastrointestinal tract or into the abdominal effusion are also possible. Hypokalemia is more
likely to occur with poor intake if there are concurrent losses of the electrolyte.


Hyperbilirubinemia: Hyperbilirubinemia is often the result of liver disease or hemolysis.
Obstructive cholestasis is unlikely given the normal ALP and GGT, however decreased liver
function (reference above) can also cause hyperbilirubinemia. Hemolysis is certainly possible
given the anemia, however hemolytic anemias are frequently regenerative and no RBC
morphologic abnormalities suggesting a cause for hemolysis were noted (i.e. spherocytes,
Heinz bodies, etc). Although liver disease and hemolysis cannot be excluded as causes for
the hyperbilirubinemia, sepsis can also result in a defect in hepatocellular uptake of bilirubin.


Mildly increased ALT and AST: Elevations in these enzymes suggest hepatocellular damage,
however they indicate nothing about the etiology of the damage. Riff Raff has multiple
potential sources for liver damage, including sepsis (effects of bacterial toxins and poor
perfusion with shock), intestinal disease with increased hepatic exposure to bacteria and
bacterial products with inflammatory mediators, trauma during surgery, and hypoxia secondary
to anemia. Primary liver disease cannot be ruled out, but is not required to account for these
enzyme elevations. The increased AST may refect muscle damage during surgery.


Coagulation profile: Mild prolongation of PT and APTT suggests the development of a
secondary hemostatic defect. In combination with the thrombocytopenia and increased fibrin
degradation products (indicating increased fibrinolysis), these findings are compatible with
disseminated intravascular coagulation, which may occur secondary to sepsis. Decreased liver
function can also cause these laboratory changes because of decreased hepatic production
of coagulation factors and impaired clearance of fibrin degradation products by the liver.
Adherence of platelets to damaged endothelium in the liver can cause thrombocytopenia.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Abdominal fluid cytology revealed large numbers of degenerate neutrophils containing
intracellular bacteria. Riff Raff was taken to surgery, where it was discovered that two of the
four enterotomy sites had dehisced. One was repaired and the other required resection and
re-anastomosis. Riff Raff was managed with an open abdomen, fluids, antibiotics, and
parenteral nutrition. Unfortunately, 5 days later, Riff Raff suffered cardiopulmonary arrest
associated with an episode of vomiting. At necropsy, Riff Raff was noted to have diffuse,
fibrous and fibrinous peritonitis. Histologic examination of tissue revealed yeast compatible
with _Candida_ species attached to the capsular surface of the liver, spleen, and intestine. Yeast
were subsequently cultured from these organs.


Although no urine was available to help interpret the increased BUN, multiple extra-renal
factors that could potentially influence the BUN were present in the clinical history. It is
helpful to compare Riff Raff with Sherpa (Chapter 5, Case 2), who also had a minor elevation
of BUN with modest elevations in liver enzymes. Despite these similarities, Riff Raff did not
have primary urinary tract disease, while Sherpa’s diagnosis was transitional cell carcinoma
with hydronephrosis and significant renal pathology due to urinary outflow obstruction. Just
as the degree of azotemia cannot always distinguish pre-renal from renal causes, neither can
a minor increase in BUN with normal creatinine distinguish renal from extra-renal pathology
in all patients.
