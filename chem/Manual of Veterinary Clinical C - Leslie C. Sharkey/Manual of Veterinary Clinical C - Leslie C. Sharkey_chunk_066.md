Increased CK: The elevated CK may be related to muscle damage from inability to move and
the development of pressure sores. Other potential causes include iatrogenic manipulation
such as surgery and intramuscular injections.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Jason was treated with antibiotics and intravenous fluids appropriately adjusted for his
electrolyte abnormalities. He also received insulin and medication to control pain. His
decubital sores were treated and he was frequently repositioned. By the next day, Jason was
able to roll over on his own and was supported to drink small bowls of water every 2 hours.
He was also given frequent small meals. Jason was hospitalized for almost two weeks, but
had a remarkable recovery with normal electrolytes, improving strength and a glucose curve
showing moderately well controlled diabetes. The wound on his left hock was also healing,
but required continuing care at home. The liver biopsy collected at surgery showed fatty
change compatible with the history of diabetes.


Like Twix, the calf in the Case 14, this chapter, fluid losses (renal due to osmotic diuresis in
this case, gastrointestinal in the previous case) combined with restricted access to water led
to hypernatremia and hyperchloremia. Serum electrolyte data and acid/base status can be
quite variable in diabetic patients depending on food intake, degree of polyuria, and any
associated gastrointestinal signs. In some diabetics, serum electrolyte values fall within the
reference interval (Hooligan, Chapter 3, Case 20), while other patients may have
hyponatremia and hypochloridemia associated with relative water excess because of the
osmotic effects of hyperglycemia (Marion, Chapter 3, Case 18). It is likely that Hooligan and
Marion had free access to water during their illness.


Case 16 – Level 3
“Decker” is an 11-year-old neutered male domestic short haired cat that presents with a
several year history of diabetes mellitus that usually is well managed. This morning, Decker
was vomiting and lethargic. On presentation, he is thin, with an unkempt coat.

###### **Interpretation**

No CBC was performed


Hyperglycemia: Given the history of diabetes mellitus, the hyperglycemia is attributed to this
previously diagnosed condition. Exacerbation by stress cannot be ruled out.


Mild azotemia: Increased BUN and creatinine indicate a decrease in glomerular filtration
rate. However, ruling out a potential renal component of azotemia in diabetic patients can be
complicated by the osmotic diuresis caused by the presence of glucose and ketones in the
urine, which prevent proper concentration of urine by normally functional kidneys. Some
degree of pre-renal azotemia is also expected.


Hyperphosphatemia: Phosphorus is not being eliminated at normal rates because of the
decreased glomerular filtration rate.


Hypocalcemia: The cause for the mild decrease in total serum calcium is not apparent here.
Mild deviations from normal may be the result of laboratory error, and should be verified. If
Decker does have renal disease, this is the most likely cause of a true hypocalcemia, however
ionized calcium may be normal and should be measured if clinically indicated.


Hypochloremia with normal serum sodium: Like the low calcium level, the deviation of
chloride from the reference interval is minimal and may not be clinically significant. There is a
history of vomiting, which could lead to loss of chloride.


Low serum bicarbonate (acidemia) with increased anion gap: This combination of
abnormalities suggests an accumulation of unmeasured anions. Ketoacidosis accounts for
much of this, however uremic acidosis or lactic acidosis secondary to dehydration and poor
perfusion cannot be ruled out. Other unmeasured anions may include exogenous
compounds. For example, ethylene glycol toxicity, while unlikely given other laboratory data
and clinical information, could present with some similar changes on the profile, including
increased anion gap, azotemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia.


Increased ALP and GGT: These enzymes often indicate cholestasis. Liver disease is common
in older cats and cannot be ruled out here, although no hyperbilirubinemia or bilirubinuria is
present at this time. Various endocrinopathies, including diabetes mellitus and hyperthyroidism, also may cause increased serum activities of these enzymes.


Increased ALT and AST: Elevations in these enzymes suggest hepatocellular damage, but
they also may increase with endocrinopathies.


Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia: Postprandial effects are unlikely in this
patient because of anorexia and vomiting. Endocrinopathies and renal disease can increase
serum lipids. In diabetes mellitus, inadequate insulin action reduces lipoprotein lipase activity
in addition to the generalized recruitment of lipids as an energy source during perceived
tissue “starvation.”

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Decker was stabilized in the hospital and sent home, where he continued to do well on a
higher dose of insulin. As discussed in the previous case, some patients with diabetes mellitus
have normal or nearly normal serum electrolyte values, especially if there are no accompanying
gastrointestinal issues and the patient is able to drink water. Decker’s hypochloremia was more
likely due to the vomiting than the actual hyperglycemia. Likewise, dehydration secondary to
osmotic diuresis can cause prerenal azotemia in some patients like Decker and Hooligan
(Chapter 3, Case 20), but not others (Jason, Chapter 7, Case 15; Marion and Amaryllis,
Chapter 3, Cases 18 and 19). Still others may have low BUN and serum creatinine as a result of
compensated polyuria/polydipsia and/or muscle wasting (Decker and Gerhardt, Chapter 5,
Case 22). Other laboratory abnormalities that can be commonly associated with diabetes
mellitus include liver enzyme elevations (Chapter 3, Cases 18, 19, 20; Chapter 5, Case 22),
hypercholesterolemia (Chapter 3, Cases 18, 19; Chapter 5, Case 22) and hypertriglyceridemia
(Chapter 3, Cases 18, 19; Chapter 5, Case 22).


Case 17 – Level 3
“Smooch” is a 4-year-old spayed female Bichon Frise presenting for lethargy, anorexia, and
tachypnea. One month ago, she presented with hematemesis and was diagnosed with
immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. She was subsequently treated with corticosteroids and
cyclosporine. At this presentation, Smooch is slightly dehydrated with pale pink mucous
membranes. Smooch’s abdomen is distended and is somewhat painful on palpation. She has
cranial organomegaly with thin skin and alopecia. She has increased bronchovesicular sounds
compatible with pneumonia.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Smooch has a marked neutrophilic leukocytosis with a mild left shift and toxic change,
and monocytosis, compatible with marked inflammation (Figure 7-5A and B). In her case, this
may be secondary to pneumonia or pancreatitis. Her steroid therapy is likely contributing to
the neutrophilia and monocytosis, however a lymphopenia characteristic of a steroid
leukogram is not present. The platelet numbers have normalized since the initiation of
treatment for immune mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP). However Smooch now has a
normocytic normochromic anemia, likely non-regenerative. A reticulocyte count is needed to
confirm this. Given the inflammatory leukogram, a nonregenerative anemia of chronic
disease/inflammation is possible.

Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: This blood glucose level is very high, and in combination with the ketonuria,
indicates diabetes mellitus. Corticosteroid treatment causes insulin resistance and could
exacerbate or precipitate clinical diabetes.


Increased BUN with low creatinine: Increased BUN with normal or low creatinine may occur
with mild pre-renal or renal decreases in glomerular filtration rate. The increased BUN in this
case may be due to gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Muscle wasting could contribute to the low
creatinine.


Hypophosphatemia and hypocalcemia: Translocation of phosphorus into cells can be
stimulated by insulin therapy, although it is not clear if Smooch has received insulin at the
time of this sample collection. Diabetic patients may have total body phosphorus deficits
because of muscle wasting, loss of phosphorus in urine, and impaired tissue phosphorus
utilization. Smooch is tachypneic, which also may trigger translocation of phosphorus into
cells. Both the low phosphorus and low calcium may be related to increased renal losses
associated with iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism. Hypovitaminosis D or gastrointestinal
disease are possible but less likely causes. Hypocalcemia may be associated with pancreatitis,
which may also explain the increased amylase and inflammatory leukogram.


Hyponatremia: The hyponatremia is likely dilutional as a result of the osmotic draw of water
into the circulation by the hyperglycemia. An alternative possibility is loss of sodium with
hemorrhage and replacement of lost fluid with free water by drinking. Given the heart
murmer, assessment of cardiac function should be considered as congestive heart failure and
fluid loading may also produce hyponatremia.


Hypokalemia: Multiple causes for hypokalemia are present in this patient. Decreased intake
makes it more difficult for Smooch to replace ongoing losses associated with polyuria and
osmotic diuresis. Vomiting could further contribute to potassium loss, and insulin therapy
may lead to translocation of potassium into cells.


Decreased serum bicarbonate (acidemia): The production of organic acids such as ketoacids
is the likely cause of the acidemia. In most cases, this would cause an increased anion gap,
however the accumulation of unmeasured anions is counterbalanced by electrolyte
abnormalities. Large amounts of ketoacids also may be eliminated in the urine, so polyuria
helps minimize their accumulation, particularly in animals that can take in enough fluid to
maintain normal hydration status.


Hyperbilirubinemia: There are several potential causes for increased serum bilirubin in this
patient. Sepsis can interfere with hepatocellular uptake of bile, and is possible given the
significant inflammatory response in the leukogram. The anemia could be caused by
hemolysis, however specific morphologic abnormalities that would corroborate that
interpretation were not noted on the blood film examination. Cholestasis appears likely given
the marked elevations in ALP and GGT, although some portion of these increases are likely
due to diabetes mellitus and treatment with corticosteroids. Primary liver disease remains a
consideration.


Increased ALP and GGT: As discussed in Chapter 2, increased ALP in the dog is a
nonspecific change that may be associated with drug effects, endocrinopathies, circulatory
disorders, bone pathology, and cholestatic liver disease. In this case, increased ALP and GGT
is due to a combination of endocrinopathy and cholestatic liver disease. It is likely that
corticosteroid induced ALP is increased due to the therapy for ITP. Although the


corticosteroid induced fraction of ALP can be measured, it may not be possible to sort out
the relative combinations of multiple factors until Smooch can be weaned off corticosteroid
therapy and her diabetes better controlled.


Increased ALT and AST: Elevated ALT and AST indicate hepatocellular damage. The relative
increases in hepatocellular enzymes are less severe than the cholestatic enzymes, however
this may be due to contributions from corticosteroid therapy and diabetes rather than
reflecting more severe cholestatic versus hepatocellular disease.


Hypercholesterolemia: Smooch is experiencing numerous potential problems that could
cause increased serum cholesterol. Hypercholesterolemia is associated with diabetes mellitus
and hypercortisolism. It may also occur with pancreatitis, suggested by the increased amylase.


Hyperamylasemia: Minor elevations of amylase (2-3 fold) may occur with decreased
glomerular filtration rate. Although Smooch is dehydrated, her serum creatinine is low,
making this difficult to assess. Pancreatitis can occur concurrently with diabetes and may be
associated with other laboratory abnormalities such as hypercholesterolemia, hypocalcemia
and an inflammatory leukogram.


Urinalysis: Osmotic diuresis due to glucose and ketones in the urine will result in a low
specific gravity. Glucose and ketones at very high concentrations can contribute minimal
increases in the urine specific gravity because standard methodology evaluates numbers of
particles in the urine and their size. Although the sediment appears inactive, urine culture
should be considered as diabetic patients are predisposed to the development of occult
urinary tract infections (McGuire).

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Smooch was treated with antibiotics and gastroprotectants along with insulin therapy for her
diabetes. Although becoming regenerative, her anemia worsened and she became hypoproteinemic secondary to gastrointestinal hemorrhage. As a result, she required a blood
transfusion. Her pneumonia gradually improved during her hospitalization. In addition, her
ketosis eventually resolved, and she was discharged on insulin with a nasogastric tube for
nutritional support. The dose of corticosteroids was reduced in order to minimize its effects
on the gastrointestinal tract and to improve sensitivity to insulin therapy.
