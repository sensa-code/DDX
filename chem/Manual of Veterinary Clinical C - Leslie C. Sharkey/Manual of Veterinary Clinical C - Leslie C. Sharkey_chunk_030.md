Increased AST: This mild elevation in the absence of other enzyme elevations suggesting
liver disease may indicate mild muscle damage of uncertain cause. Prolonged coagulation
times with thrombocytopenia suggest DIC. Liver dysfunction also may contribute to
secondary hemostatic defects.


Urinalysis: Since the patient is not azotemic and there is no description of dehydration in the
physical examination, the urine specific gravity may be compatible with normal function. The


history does indicate increased water consumption, which could be in response to the
production of larger volumes of more dilute urine, or conversely, could cause the production
of larger volumes of more dilute urine. Urine concentrating ability is usually lost prior to the
development of azotemia during the progression of renal disease, although this may not
always be true in cats.


Abdominal fluid analysis: The results of this analysis indicate a non-septic exudate. One
study of 65 cats with peritoneal effusion showed the following causes in decreasing order of
frequency: cardiovascular disease, neoplasia, liver disease, renal disease, feline infectious
peritonitis, other peritoneal disease, and urinary tract trauma (Wright). Non-septic exudates
are often associated with neoplasia or feline infectious peritonitis.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

The combination of the neutrophilic leukocytosis with left shift, nonregenerative anemia, and
non-septic exudate in the abdomen was suggestive for feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in this
young cat. A diagnosis of FIP may be suggested by the presence of this combination of
abnormalities on routine blood testing, however definitive diagnosis is not possible without
further work-up (Hartmann). A feline coronavirus titer was positive at 1:1600. Feline
coronavirus titers must be interpreted with care, since many cats that never develop FIP have
positive titers. Some cats with effusive FIP can have negative or low titers because antibodies
are bound in the production of antigen-antibody complexes and are not available for binding
with test antigen (Addie). Hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of liver enzyme abnormalities
also occurs in cats with FIP and is unlikely in cats with other types of hepatobiliary disease.
Because of poor quality of life and questionable prognosis, Susannah was euthanized. At
necropsy, she had accumulation of gelatinous fluid in both the abdominal and thoracic
cavities. There were multifocal raised yellow nodules covering the liver, intestines and
kidneys, compatible with perivascular granuloma formation characteristic of FIP.


Note that multiple processes in this case are influencing Susannah’s protein values and that
the sum of the abnormalities is resulting in a normal serum total protein value. This is a good
illustration of how a “normal” value does not rule out the presence of disease and
demonstrates that fractionation of total protein into albumin and globulins can be much
more informative than just the total protein value. In previous patients, a “normal” total
protein value failed to reflect low serum albumin due to starvation (Belinda, Case 1) and
decreased liver function associated with a portosystemic shunt (Dylan, Case 2).

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Slurpee has neutropenia, monocytopenia, a mild normocytic normochromic anemia,
and thrombocytopenia. A platelet count is recommended to confirm the thrombocytopenia.
Pancytopenia is an indication for bone marrow evaluation if peripheral causes cannot account
for the cytopenias. While not typically seen in normal dogs, rouleaux may occur in association
with the high globulin levels in this patient.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypercalcemia with normal phosphorus: The potential for neoplasia should always be
considered in hypercalcemic dogs, especially middle aged to older patients. While
hypercalcemia is most often associated with adenocarcinomas of the anal sac, lymphoma, or
multiple myeloma, it has been reported with numerous other malignancies in domestic
animals. There are no specific abnormalities in the history or physical examination that
indicate a potential source for the hypercalcemia, however because of the concurrent
pancytopenia, the bone marrow should be evaluated for tumor infiltration. The hyperglobulinemia further suggests the possibility of a lymphoid malignancy as the cause for the
hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is often associated with normal or low
phosphorus. Decreased glomerular filtration rate secondary to hypercalcemic nephropathy
and/or dehydration may cause the serum phosphorus to be normal to increased.


Hyperproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia and hyperglobulinemia: Despite hypoalbuminemia, the total serum protein level is high because of marked increases in serum
globulins. Hypoalbuminemia may be due to decreased production or increased losses, while
the hyperglobulinemia indicates increased production. Decreased production of albumin may
be related to nutritional status (unlikely here because the patient has good body condition),
decreased liver function (cannot be ruled out since blood ammonia or serum bile acids were
not measured, however BUN, cholesterol, and bilirubin are within reference intervals), a
compensatory change in response to inflammation (albumin is a negative acute phase
reactant) or a response to the increased oncotic pressure exerted by the high globulin levels.
Increased losses may occur with or without decreased production. Selective loss of albumin is
most frequently associated with glomerular lesions, and proteinuria is noted on the urinalysis.
This should be further evaluated by measuring a urine protein:creatinine ratio on a urine
collected by cystocentesis to avoid potential contamination with protein from the lower
urinary tract. A high urine protein:creatinine ratio in the absence of evidence of inflammatory
disease is compatible with glomerular protein loss. The test strips used for routine urinalysis
are more sensitive for albumin than globulins, and false negatives may occur in the rare case
where urine protein is predominantly globulin. Other types of protein loss (GI, dermal, third
space, interstitial) are generally non-selective and result in loss of albumin and globulins. Loss
of globulin in this case may be masked by the marked hyperglobulinemia. Over production
of globulins is most often due to inflammatory disease, in which case both acute phase


reactants and immunoglobulins may be produced. The increase in immunoglobulins will
generally be polyclonal, however in rare cases inflammatory disease can cause a monoclonal
gammopathy. Examples include feline infectious peritonitis, rickettsial diseases, and
Leishmaniasis. Over production of globulins can be a paraneoplastic syndrome in which a
malignant clone of lymphocytes or plasma cells produces a single globulin protein, resulting
in a monoclonal gammopathy. Serum protein electrophoresis can be performed as a
diagnostic aid to distinguish polyclonal from monoclonal gammopathy.


Mildly decreased ALP and ALT: Decreases in the serum levels of these enzymes do not have
diagnostic significance (See Chapter 2). Specifically, they should not be used as evidence of
decreased liver function to explain the hypoalbuminemia.


Urinalysis: The urine is not optimally concentrated for a dehydrated patient, however
Slurpee is not azotemic, nor is she yet isosthenuric. Abnormalities of urinary concentrating
ability may be related to her hypercalcemia (See Chapter 5, Case 4). The proteinuria should
be verified, and a urine protein:creatinine ratio performed (see above). In this case, a urine
protein electrophoresis may be indicated to identify light chains that may be present in cases
of paraneoplastic gammopathy. The occasional white cells and red cells may be contaminants
in the voided sample.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Based on the pancytopenia, hypercalcemia, and hyperglobulinemia, a lymphoid malignancy
was suspected. Bone marrow aspirate revealed that 75% of the nucleated cells in the bone
marrow were plasma cells; both mature and immature cells were present mixed with small
numbers of normal hematopoietic precursors (Figure 4-3). A monoclonal gammopathy was
documented by serum protein electrophoresis. Survey radiographs to look for lytic lesions
and urine protein electrophoresis were not performed because of financial concerns.
Treatment was initiated for multiple myeloma based on the existing data.


Figure 4-3. Cytology of the bone
marrow aspirate showing
numerous neoplastic plasma cells.


Slurpee can be compared with Cleopatra (Chapter 6, Case 7), a cat with multiple myeloma. In
both cases, concurrent hypercalcemia increased the index of suspicion that hyperglobulinemia could be due to the presence of an immunoglobulin producing malignancy. Neither
Slurpee nor Cleopatra had an inflammatory leukogram, in contrast to Susannah (Case 7), who
had hypoalbuminemia and high-normal globulins associated with an infectious disease.
Serum protein electrophoresis may not be necessary in hyperglobulinemic animals when
there is obvious clinical evidence of inflammation and the patient is considered at low risk for


neoplasia (Susannah was a young cat). In other cases such as Popcorn (Chapter 5, Case 24), a
patient may have inflammatory disease, in this case pyometra, however due to age or
concurrent laboratory abnormalities, a more thorough diagnostic work-up is appropriate. In
Popcorn’s case, hyperglobulinemia was associated with hypercalcemia, therefore a serum
protein electrophoresis was performed to help rule out the potential for neoplasia prior to
surgical correction of her pyometra.


Case 9 – Level 2
“Salty” is an 11-year-old Quarter Horse stallion presenting for increasingly severe colic of 12
hours duration. On physical examination, Salty is depressed, painful, and attempting to lie
down. His coat is drenched with sweat and he has tachycardia. There is dried blood on both
nares, possibly related to inadvertent removal of his nasogastric tube during transportation,
when he went down several times. He is moderately dehydrated with prolonged capillary
refill time and muddy mucous membranes. Salty was immediately treated for pain, however a
nasogastric tube could not be passed. Rectal palpation revealed severely distended large
bowel. His initial PCV was 60% and total solids were 6.6 g/dl. Further diagnostic evaluation
could not be performed because he had to be almost constantly walked to prevent him from
going down. As a result, he received several liters of fluids before samples for further
laboratory evaluation could be collected.

###### **Interpretation**

Increased Hematocrit: This is compatible with dehydration or splenic contraction secondary
to excitement in the horse.


Serum biochemical profile:
Hyperglycemia: The increased serum glucose is likely related to pain and stress.


Increased BUN and creatinine: Salty is significantly dehydrated and polycythemic at
presentation, so there is a pre-renal component to the azotemia. A urine sample could not


be obtained, so a urine specific gravity is not available to assess urinary concentrating ability
and the potential for renal disease.


Hypermagnesemia: This abnormality is likely associated with decreased glomerular filtration
rate secondary to dehydration.


Hyperalbuminemia: Dehydration/hemoconcentration is the cause for increase serum albumin.


Hypochloremia with normal serum sodium: At this time serum sodium is within the
reference interval and there is a disproportionate change in chloride, but the significance is
unclear in light of the potential effects of fluid therapy initiated prior to sample collection.
The low serum chloride could be due to gastrointestinal losses or sweating.


Mildly increased anion gap: Accumulation of unmeasured anions could include increased
proteins with hemoconcentration or lactic acidosis associated with poor tissue perfusion. This
change is not yet accompanied by a decrease in HCO3 which often accompanies the
accumulation of unmeasured organic acids such as lactic acid. Although Salty is hyperglycemic,
ketoacidosis is unlikely given the clinical history. Likewise, although he is azotemic, uremic
acidosis is unlikely because pre-renal factors can probably account for the decreased
glomerular filtration rate. Ideally, serum glucose, BUN, creatinine, and urine specific gravity
should be re-evaluated in subsequent blood work to confirm these impressions.


Hyperbilirubinemia: In horses, anorexia should always be considered as a cause of hyperbilirubinemia. In this clinical context, sepsis associated with bowel compromise could also
contribute. Liver disease is less likely since the GGT is within the reference interval, however
hepatic pathology cannot be completely ruled out. Significant intestinal disease can impact
the liver secondarily as well.


Increased AST and CK: Elevations in both of these enzymes suggest muscle damage and are
compatible with Salty’s travel history and episodes of recumbency.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

During induction of anesthesia in preparation for surgery, Salty suffered respiratory arrest,
became non-responsive, and was humanely euthanized. A limited necropsy revealed severely
gas-distended large bowel and a 360 degree torsion of the large colon at the base of the
cecum. Both arterial and venous supply was compromised, and the mucosa was black,
compatible with ischemic necrosis.
