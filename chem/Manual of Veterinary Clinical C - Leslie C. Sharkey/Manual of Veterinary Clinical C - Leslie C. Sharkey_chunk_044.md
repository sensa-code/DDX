Azotemia and Urinalysis: Azotemia in conjunction with concentrated urine indicates prerenal azotemia. Dehydration secondary to colic will contribute to pre-renal azotemia. Poor
tissue perfusion secondary to systemic vasodilation with sepsis can also be a factor. While the
urine specific gravity at this time supports pre-renal azotemia, the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatories at high doses or in combination with other nephrotoxic drugs or dehydration
can cause kidney damage and needs to be monitored (see Joe, Chapter 5, Case 11, and
Calvin, Chapter 2, Case 20).


Hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia: The most likely cause for the hyperphosphatemia in
this case is decreased glomerular filtration rate. The hypocalcemia may reflect the hypoalbuminemia. Colic is often associated with decreases in both total and ionized calcium, though
the mechanism is still uncertain. Calcium wasting in the urine did not appear to contribute to
the hypocalcemia in horses with colic (Toribio). Acute renal failure in horses also can be
characterized by hypocalcemia, possibly due to renal wastage. In contrast, chronic renal
failure may be associated with hypercalcemia because the large amounts of calcium that are
normally excreted in the urine can no longer be eliminated by this route. Low serum ionized
calcium levels can be caused by low magnesium states due to inadequate action of
parathyroid hormone. Ionized calcium levels can be performed to further evaluate Faith’s
calcium status.


Hypomagnesemia: Like calcium, magnesium is protein bound and may decrease secondary
to hypoproteinemia. Prolonged anorexia and excess urinary elimination may also be factors.
Ionized magnesium may be low in horses with colic (Toribio).


Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia: Selective hypoalbuminemia is most often the result
of either decreased production (inadequate liver function, starvation) or increased losses via
glomerular lesions. Most other causes of increased protein loss, such as cutaneous, gastrointestinal, or third space losses, result in a deficit of both globulins and albumin. Based on the
clinical history, gastrointestinal losses of protein are most likely in this case. It is likely that Faith
actually has increased production of acute phase reactants and/or immunoglobulins secondary
to inflammation that is offseting the gastrointestinal losses of protein and keeping the globulin
measurement in the reference interval.


Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Hypertonic fluid losses related to colic are the probable
cause of these electrolyte abnormalities. Sweating from pain associated with laminitis or colic is
another possible route for loss of sodium and chloride. If isotonic fluid losses are replaced by
drinking water, hyponatremia and hypochloremia can result. Lipemia can cause artifactually
lower electrolyte values, depending on the methodology used to measure these analytes. If an
analyzer employs indirect potentiometry with ion specific electrodes in which the sample is
diluted as part of the assay, artifactual lowering of electrolyte concentrations may be observed
with severe lipemia. This occurs with analyzers such as the Hitachi 911. With direct
potentiometric methods using ion specific electrodes in which there is no sample dilution,
lipemic interference with measurement of electrolyte concentrations would not be anticipated.
If sodium and chloride are both decreased in an obviously lactescent sample, another
methodology should be used to confirm concentrations of these electrolytes.


Increased anion gap: This value reflects an accumulation of unmeasured anions, which could
include lactic acid in this patient. Increased anion gap is often associated with a low HCO3
compatible with acidosis, however here the HCO3 is still at the lower end of the reference
range.


Hyperbilirubinemia: The most likely cause of hyperbilirubinemia in a sick horse is anorexia.
Given the normal PCV, hemolysis is unlikely. Cholestasis is possible given the increased liver
enzymes.


Increased ALP and GGT: In an adult horse, increased GGT is evidence for liver damage and
cholestasis. This change is often associated with hyperbilirubinemia, although bilirubin can be
efficiently eliminated in the urine. ALP is less liver specific than GGT and may be slightly less
sensitive in the horse. These enzyme elevations are not specific as to the etiology of the liver
insult. The combination of lipemia and elevated liver enzymes in a recently anorexic obese pony
suggests the possibility of hyperlipemia and hepatic lipidosis.


Increased AST and CK: AST is present in multiple tissues and elevations can be difficult to
interpret. In Faith, the concurrent increase in ALP and GGT supports the potential for hepatic
origin, yet the concurrent increase in CK indicates that muscle damage has occurred and may
be responsible for some of the increase in AST. Like ALP and GGT, elevations in AST are not
specific as to the etiology of the liver damage. Note that none of these enzymes are liver
function tests. It is necessary to measure blood ammonia or serum bile acids to confirm liver
dysfunction in this case, especially since the hyperbilirubinemia could be explained by
decreased feed intake.


Hypertriglyceridemia: Fasting hypertriglyceridemia is considered abnormal, and may be
associated with metabolic disorders, liver or pancreatic disease, and endocrinopathies. Fasted
horses with hypertriglyceridemia should be evaluated for hyperlipemia/hyperlipidemia
syndrome, which can be triggered by feed restriction or anorexia during colic episodes (Mogg).
The syndrome is caused by decreased feed intake with subsequent fat mobilization and
accumulation in the plasma and liver. Faith is more appropriately categorized as hyperlipemia


because her plasma is lipemic and her triglycerides exceed 500 mg/dl. Hyperlipemia is a more
serious condition accompanied by lactescent plasma, impaired hepatic function and the
production of abnormal very low density lipoproteins that have less apolipoprotein B-100 and
more apolipoprotein B-48. This substitution may allow greater triglyceride content.


Abdominal fluid: Normal. There is nothing in the abdominal fluid analysis to suggest peritonitis
as the cause of the inflammatory leukogram.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Faith was treated with intravenous fluids and dextrose, antibiotics, and analgesics (avoiding
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories). She remained stable overnight, but began to deteriorate,
becoming increasingly painful and eventually showing signs of endotoxemia. Ultimately, Faith
was euthanized for humane reasons because of her lack of response to therapy. Clinicians felt
that the gastrointestinal lesions might have been related to the use of non-steroidal antiinflammatories used to treat the initial laminitis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are
thought to induce injury by direct topical effects and inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis that
contributes to maintenance of mucosal barrier in the gastrointestinal system (Tomlinson).

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Forsythia has leucopenia with neutropenia and lymphopenia. Hyperfibrinoginemia and
toxic change indicate inflammation, which may be too acute for the development of
neutrophilia or a left shift. Sepsis and consumption of neutrophils may contribute to the
neutropenia. Alternatively, in combination with the nonregenerative anemia, a primary bone
marrow disease could be considered. The clinical history and biochemistry data are
compatible with renal disease, which could explain a nonregenerative anemia in the absence
of marrow pathology. Lymphopenia may indicate corticosteroid effects, or potentially lysis
secondary to a viral infection.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Stress and corticosteroid effects can result in hyperglycemia in llamas, which
appear to have poor insulin responses (Cebra). The lymphopenia is also compatible with
corticosteroid effects. The combination of hyperglycemia and glucosuria is suggestive for
diabetes mellitus, but may also result from transient increases in blood glucose over the
transport maximum in the kidney. Persistent hyperglycemia with or without ketonemia is
needed for a diagnosis of diabetes.


Severe azotemia: In combination with the isosthenuria and oral lesions, renal disease is the
likely cause of the azotemia, although pre-renal factors may exacerbate the increases in BUN
and creatinine. The oral lesions are compatible with uremia. Given the history of straining and
rectal prolapse, urinary obstruction should be ruled out.


Hypocalcemia: This abnormality may related to the hypoalbuminemia, however a
quantitative relationship between the two values cannot be determined. Increased urinary
losses of calcium associated with renal disease also could contribute to hypocalcemia. While


not present in this patient, decreases in calcium in conjunction with hyperphosphatemia have
been described in llamas with decreased glomerular filtration rate secondary to urethral
obstruction (Gerros).


Hypermagnesemia: Increased magnesium is associated with decreased glomerular filtration
rate.


Hypoalbuminemia: Proteinuria suggests the potential for renal protein loss, however the
presence of leukocytes, bacteria, and erythrocytes in the urine indicates that lower urinary tract
disease could explain the proteinuria. Urine protein:creatinine ratios should be measured after
successful treatment of any urinary tract infection. Although the owners do not report diarrhea,
fecal staining of her perineum suggests that gastrointestinal losses of protein are possible.
However, one would expect losses of both globulins and albumin in protein losing enteropathy.
Globulin loss may be masked by increased production due to inflammation. Forsythia’s history
of chronic weight loss and poor body condition are compatible with starvation as a cause for
hypoalbuminemia.


Hypochloremia with normal serum sodium: Gastrointestinal sequestration and salivary losses
of chloride will decrease serum chloride. Acid/base abnormalities are also associated with
changes in chloride that are disproportionate to sodium, however chloride usually varies
inversely with HCO3, which is not the case in this patient. When chloride and HCO3 change in
the same direction, a mixed acid/base disorder is suspected, and arterial blood gases should be
evaluated for more complete characterization of the process. Renal losses of chloride can be
quantifed by measuring urinary fractional excretion, and normal values are available in the
literature (Garry).


Hypokalemia: In this case, the combination of decreased intake and excessive losses via the
gastrointestinal or urinary tract explain the low serum potassium. Hypokalemia is most often
associated with polyuric renal failure because increased tubular flow rates decrease
reabsorption of potassium. Inability to eliminate urine in oliguric/anuric renal failure or with
urinary outflow obstruction more often causes retention of potassium and hyperkalemia.


Increased anion gap and low HCO3: These changes suggest acidemia with accumulation of
unmeasured anions, such as uremic acids. The hyperglycemia and glucosuria could be
compatible with diabetes mellitus, and ketoacids also can increase the anion gap. In this case
the urine did not contain ketones, and the hyperglycemia could be attributable to stress.


Increased GGT, AST, and CK: Elevated serum GGT may indicate hepatic necrosis or cholestatic
liver disease, though this is unlikely given the normal bilirubin. GGT and AST will increase with
hepatic lipidosis which can develop in anorexic camelids. However, lipidosis, usually, occurs
when there are increased caloric demands such as with pregnancy or lactation (Tornquist). Both
liver and muscle damage can increase AST. Based on the increased CK, at least of portion of
the elevation in AST is from muscle. Muscle damage may be related to administration of
intramuscular injections or any episodes of recumbency.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Based on a poor long-term prognosis, Forsythia was humanely euthanized. At necropsy, only
mild lymphoplasmacytic inflammation was noted around larger bile ducts. There was no
evidence of liver necrosis or hepatic lipidosis. Erythroid hypoplasia was apparent in the marrow,
consistent with chronic renal disease as a cause for the anemia. Proteinaceous casts were found
in the renal tubules, some of which contained neutrophils. Glomerular adhesions and sclerosis
with diffuse interstitial fibrosis were considered compatible with glomerulonephritis. As is
usually the case, the cause of the lesion could not be determined, however the pattern was


more consistent with immune complex deposition than nephrotoxicity. The glomerular lesions
support protein losing nephropathy as a contributing factor to the hypoalbuminemia.


Immune-complex deposition is a common cause of glomerulonephritis in the horse, and
subclinical disease may be present in horses as an incidental finding at necropsy (Slauson).
Other times, glomerulonephritis culminates in the development of chronic renal failure,
although not all patients with glomerulonephritis are azotemic at presentation (Van Biervliet). It
is also possible for patients with glomerulonephritis to present with azotemia and concentrated
urine. In the absence of pre-renal azotemia, this may be explained as the result of glomerulotubular imbalance in which glomerular filtration decreases to below 75% of normal, but tubular
function is maintained (Grant).
