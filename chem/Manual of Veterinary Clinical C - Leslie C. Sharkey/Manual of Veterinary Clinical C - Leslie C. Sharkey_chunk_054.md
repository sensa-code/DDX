Star was treated with intravenous fluids, antihypertensive medication, and gastroprotectants.
Her urine culture was negative and the urine protein:creatinine ratio was markedly elevated,
compatible with glomerular disease. The clinicians decided against performing a renal biopsy
to confirm this impression because they did not feel that additional information that would
alter the treatment plan would be gained and they were concerned about complications from
the procedure. Star was discharged from the hospital, however she returned a week later
after developing diarrhea. On presentation she was very weak, and had pale mucous
membranes and melena. It was thought that Star had developed gastrointestinal ulceration
from uremia and she was humanely euthanized because of her poor prognosis.


Hypoalbuminemia is often used as a criterion for the diagnosis of glomerular disease,
however several factors may influence serum albumin levels. At presentation, Star was
dehydrated, which increased her serum albumin. In addition, patients with healthy livers and
an adequate diet can often maintain serum albumin concentrations for some period of time
despite significant losses. Patients that do have hypoalbuminemia associated with glomerular
disease may have total serum hypocalcemia, however this is not always the case. For
example, Sheba (Chapter 5, Case 5) presented with hypoalbuminemia that was attributed to
renal disease, however her total serum calcium was within reference intervals. The
unpredictable effects of renal disease on calcium may contribute to complexity in the
relationship between total serum calcium and albumin. As always with renal disease, serum
ionized calcium must be measured for optimal evaluation of calcium status (Schenck).

Case 12 – Level 3
“Jill” is a 3-year-old spayed female indoor/outdoor domestic short haired cat. She presented
recumbent and poorly responsive to stimuli. When the cat came inside last night, she was
lethargic and vomited. On physical examination, Jill is bradycardic, hypothermic, and
obtunded. The urinary bladder could not be located on abdominal palpation.

###### **Interpretation**

No CBC was performed because of financial limitations


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: The most likely cause for the hyperglycemia in this case is stress. Concurrent
illness may exacerbate the effects of stress on blood glucose concentration (Rand).


Azotemia: The azotemia in this patient is difficult to categorize as pre-renal, renal, or postrenal because there is no information about urinary concentrating ability. The absence of a
palpable urinary bladder could be compatible with failure of urine production or ruptured
bladder secondary to urethral blockage or trauma such as being hit by a car. The electrolyte
abnormalities are compatible with uroabdomen (see Chapter 5, Case 18), however there is
no description of fluid accumulation in the peritoneal cavity. Because the cat goes outdoors,
the history provided by the owners may be incomplete.


Hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia: Hyperphosphatemia in this case is most likely due
to decreased glomerular filtration rate and the inability to eliminate urine from the body.
Calcium levels are variable in renal failure and total values may not correlate with ionized
calcium as they often do in patients with normal renal function. Hypocalcemia may occur
secondary to hyperphosphatemia, and acute renal failure can result in more pronounced


hypocalcemia than chronic renal failure because of inadequate time for physiologic
compensation. Early effects of ethylene glycol intoxication can include hyperphosphatemia
because of the high content of this mineral in the antifreeze fluid. Calcium may be chelated
by metabolites of ethylene glycol resulting in hypocalcemia. The owners should be
questioned about access to anti-freeze.


Hypochloremia and increased anion gap: Hypochloremia in the absence of hyponatremia
may be due to disproportionate loss of chloride with vomiting, which was noted in the
clinical history. Hypochloremia can also be associated with acid/base abnormalities. The low
bicarbonate supports the presence of acidemia, however the markedly elevated anion gap
suggests a greater acid/base disturbance than the mildly low HCO3 would suggest. Uremic
acidosis may combine with vomiting induced alkalosis to create a mixed acid/base disorder.
Candidates for unmeasured anions contributing to the high anion gap in this case include
uremic acids, lactic acid (poor perfusion and dehydration), or exogenous acids, including
metabolites of ethylene glycol.


Hyperkalemia: Hyperkalemia is most often present in acute or acute-on-chronic renal failure
patients with low urine output and reflects inadequate renal elimination of potassium.


Increased ALT and AST: The elevated ALT is compatible with hepatocellular damage; AST is
less tissue specific and could also reflect cellular damage of other tissues such as muscle.
Inadequate perfusion of many tissues is likely in a patient presenting with bradycardia and
hypothermia.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Jill was treated with a bolus of fluids and calcium gluconate, however there was little response
and no urine production was observed. She was euthanized due to poor prognosis. After
further questioning, the owner did recall leakage of anti-freeze from one of the family cars,
but no necropsy was performed to pursue a definitive diagnosis.


This case should be compared with Brianna (Chapter 5, Case 21), a dog with renal failure
secondary to ethylene glycol ingestion. Both Jill and Brianna had the classical azotemia with
hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia that may characterize ethylene glycol toxicity,
however a more complete data base was obtained for Brianna that was able to document
isosthenuria. Characteristic calcium oxalate crystals were not noted in either patient.
Electrolyte patterns were similar in these two cases, however Jill also had liver enzyme
elevations, probably attributable to her more serious perfusion deficits on presentation.


Based on the calcium/phosphorus pattern, other differentials for Jill could have included
renal disease of other etiologies including urethral obstruction (see Chapter 5, Case 7 with
hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia), acute pancreatitis with decreased glomerular
filtration rate, and hypoparathyroidism (Case 3). Remember that amylase is a poor indicator
of pancreatitis in cats, so the normal value in this patient should not be used to rule out this
diagnosis, however most cats have a more chronic and indolent form of the disease.
Hypoparathyroidism by itself is unlikely to account for the azotemia.

Case 13 – Level 3
“Isabelle” is a 2-year-old spayed female Cocker Spaniel presenting for a two week history of
lethargy, weight loss, intermittent trembling and anorexia. She has been vomiting yellow liquid
three times a day. She responded temporarily to intravenous fluid therapy however she is now
ill again. On physical examination, Isabelle is thin (2/5 body condition score), approximately
12% dehydrated, and has bradycardia with thready pulses. Muscle tremors are noted.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: There is a mild mature neutrophilic leukocytosis that could reflect mild inflammation,
although no bands or toxic features are present to confirm this impression. A corticosteroid
leukogram is unlikely since the lymphocyte numbers are within the reference range.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia: Isabelle is significantly dehydrated on physical examination, therefore a
component of the azotemia is pre-renal. No urine specific gravity is available, so renal
azotemia cannot be excluded at this time.


Hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcemia: Renal failure, vitamin D toxicity, and hypoadrenocorticism can produce these changes. Both renal failure and hypoadrenocorticism are
compatible with the other laboratory data. In both these conditions, inadequate glomerular
filtration rate decreases elimination of phosphorus and leads to its accumulation in the blood.
Hypoadrenocorticism is a common cause of hypercalcemia in dogs, but is not associated with
increases in ionized calcium and is therefore not pathogenic. Diminished renal excretion of
calcium due to cortisol deficiency and hemoconcentration are potential mechanisms for the
hypercalcemia. The calcium level should normalize quickly after initiation of therapy.
Hypercalcemia of malignancy is common in dogs and should always be considered, however
malignant neoplasia is less likely in young dogs.


Hypermagnesemia: Decreased glomerular filtration rate is the cause for the high
magnesium.


Hyperproteinemia with hyperalbuminemia: Because the liver does not produce excess
albumin (see Chapter 4), hyperalbuminemia is evidence for hemoconcentration. This is
compatible with the dehydration described in the physical examination.


Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Even though Isabelle has been anorexic, inadequate
intake is rarely the cause of low sodium and chloride in small animal patients on commercial
diets. Given her history, gastrointestinal losses are possible. Electrolytes may also be lost
through the skin or into body cavities, however potassium is often lost as well, and Isabelle is
hyperkalemic. Renal losses of sodium and chloride can be quantified by performing urinary
fractional excretions. Patients with hyponatremia should have low urinary fractional excretion
of sodium as the body attempts to conserve the electrolyte. Normal to increased fractional
excretion of sodium under these circumstances would be abnormal and reflect either renal
disease or hypoadrenocorticism. With Addisonians, the lack of aldosterone release from the
adrenal gland results in a failure to conserve sodium by the kidney.


Hyperkalemia: Hyperkalemia is most often the result of inability to eliminate adequate
amounts of potassium through the kidneys. In combination with hyponatremia and
hypochloremia, it is characteristic of hypoadrenocorticism. Potassium may also accumulate
with anuric/oliguric renal failure or in association with post-renal azotemia due to urethral
blockage or uroabdomen. Discriminating between these differential diagnoses requires a
thorough physical examination and history with ancillary laboratory data such as urinalysis
and ACTH stimulation testing.


Low HCO3 and high anion gap: The acidemia and elevated anion gap in this case may be
related to either uremic acidosis or lactic acidosis secondary to poor tissue perfusion.
Because most of the anion gap in health is due to negatively charged proteins, the hyperalbuminemia could also contribute to increased anion gap.


Increased amylase: The mild change in this value is most compatible with the decreased
glomerular filtration rate, although gastrointestinal disease can also be associated with
increased amylase and is compatible with the clinical history. Pancreatic disease cannot be
ruled out, but is not required to explain this data.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Isabelle was treated with shock doses of intravenous fluids to correct her dehydration and to
help decrease her serum potassium levels by increasing renal excretion via diuresis. An
adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) stimulation test did not demonstrate any response. Her
baseline cortisol was 0.3 µg/dl (0.5-4.0 reference interval) and her post-ACTH stimulation
cortisol was 0.2 µg/dl (8.0-20.0 reference interval). Isabelle was treated for hypoadrenocorticism (Addison’s disease). The abnormalities on her serum biochemical profile normalized
over the next few days and she was discharged from the hospital.


Isabelle can be compared with other cases of hypoadrenocorticism, including Kazoo (Chapter
3, Case 12) and Miranda (Chapter 5, Case 23). In contrast to Isabelle and Miranda, Kazoo did
not initially have the classical electrolyte abnormalities that usually characterize hypoadrenocorticism. In addition, his protein values were low because Kazoo had a history of a gastrointestinal foreign body and surgery that resulted in hypoproteinemia. These factors may have
contributed to his normal calcium value, although only about one third of patients with
hypoadrenocorticism are hypercalcemic. Miranda’s serum biochemical profile abnormalities
more closely approximate Isabelle’s, however like Kazoo, Miranda was hypoglycemic. While
sepsis may have contributed to Kazoo’s hypoglycemia, low blood glucose is a feature of
hypoadrenocorticism that Isabelle did not have.


Case 14 – Level 3
“Deputy” is a 10-year-old castrated male English Springer Spaniel presenting with a history
of severe pyoderma and allergic dermatitis. On presentation, Deputy is dull and depressed
and is in lateral recumbency in his kennel. He is dehydrated, has abdominal distension, and
icteric mucous membranes. Crusted, ulcerative lesions extend along Deputy’s entire dorsal
surface and down the length of all four limbs.
