Serum Biochemical Profile
Mildly increased BUN with normal creatinine: Possible causes for disproportionately
increased BUN in this patient include pre-renal azotemia, early renal failure, high protein diet
or gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Denver is dehydrated, however he also has poorly
concentrated urine, which is compatible with a combination of pre-renal azotemia with
possible early renal failure. There does not appear to be any non-renal factors that would
interfere with urinary concentrating ability at this time (e.g. osmotic diuresis, medullary
washout, liver failure, etc.; see Chapter 5). Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypoproteinemia
could be compatible with gastrointestinal hemorrhage, so careful evaluation for melena,
hematochezia, and hematemesis is recommended.


Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia and normal globulins: Low serum levels of
albumin may occur as a result of decreased production, increased losses, or a combination of
the two. Albumin production may be low if there is severe prolonged starvation, if there is
severe liver dysfunction, or in the presence of inflammatory disease because albumin is a
negative acute phase reactant. Starvation is unlikely based on the physical examination. Liver
dysfunction is also unlikely given the normal cholesterol, normal liver enzymes, increased
BUN, and normal coagulation times, but specific tests of liver function have not been
performed. Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia indicates the potential for antigenic stimulation,
which could result in low albumin production and increased globulin production. Protein
losses may be selective for albumin (glomerular losses) or non-selective (hemorrhage,
gastrointestinal, dermal, third space, interstitial). In this case, the albumin is low and globulins
are normal, suggesting selective glomerular protein loss, which is supported by the increased
urinary protein:creatinine ratio in the absence of indicators of inflammation in the urinary
tract (negative sediment). Non-selective protein losses may also be occurring, which could
bring serum globulin levels back into the normal range despite increased production of acute
phase reactants and/or immunoglobulins associated with inflammation. The edema noted in
Denver’s paws could be due to hypoalbuminemia or because vasculitis is increasing capillary
permeability, leading to interstitial loss of protein.


Mildly increased AST: In the absence of any other enzyme elevations, the clinical significance
of this value is uncertain. The normal ALT makes hepatocellular damage unlikely, so AST may
reflect mild hemolysis or muscle damage.


Increased serum amylase: The increased amylase likely reflects decreased glomerular
filtration rate. Pancreatitis cannot be ruled out, but clinical signs expected with pancreatitis
are not obvious at this time.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Denver was treated with intravenous fluids, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and
antibiotics for tick borne diseases, even though serologic evaluation for Lyme disease, Ehrlichia,
Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, heartworm, and leptospirosis were all negative. Unfortunately,
his kidney biopsy contained only fragments of medulla and no glomeruli were present to
classify the renal disease histologically. Denver was fed a renal diet to help with long term
management of kidney disease. Denver’s joint pain was evaluated by the orthopedic staff, who
felt that it was related to soft tissue swelling outside of the joints, with the exception of a
possible partial cruciate tear on the right. Serum antithrombin III (ATIII) levels were also
measured, and found to be low (47%, canine reference interval 75-120%). Antithrombin III is an
endogeneous anticoagulant protein that is of a similar size as albumin and may be lost via the
glomerulus in patients with protein losing nephropathy. Low ATIII predisposes patients to the
formation of thrombi, so Denver was also treated with anticoagulants.


Case 6 – Level 2
“Snickers” is a 10-week-old male black Labrador puppy presenting with a 3 day history of
anorexia, intermittent vomiting, and bloody diarrhea with mucus. He was adopted three
weeks ago along with his sister, who is not sick. According to the owner, he has had one
“set” of vaccinations. On physical examination, Snickers is depressed with pale mucous
membranes. He has an episode of extremely bloody diarrhea on the examination table.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Snickers has neutropenia and a mild normocytic normochromic nonregenerative
anemia. The anemia is likely due, in part, to acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The
neutropenia may be attributable to sepsis or severe acute inflammation in the gut, although
there is no toxic change or left shift to help substantiate this interpretation. Because a
bicytopenia is present, marrow disorders should also be considered. In such a young dog,
toxic insults should be ruled out, including medication; however the most common cause of
neutropenia in young dogs like Snickers is viral infection such as parvovirus. A parvovirus test
is strongly recommended, while a bone marrow evaluation is not indicated at this time.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Low serum creatinine: This value may be related to low muscle mass in puppies.


Panhypoproteinemia: The most obvious cause of the hypoproteinemia in this patient is
gastrointestinal loss, which is non-selective. Decreased production of albumin because of
starvation or liver dysfunction is possible, however not required to explain the hypoalbuminemia given the severity of the gastrointestinal signs. Globulin levels may be low in
juvenile animals because they have been exposed to relatively small numbers of antigens
compared to adults.


Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: These electrolyte deficits are attributable to gastrointestinal losses. The potassium is at the low end of the reference interval for the same
reasons, and may decrease further with continuing losses compounded by inadequate intake.


Mildly increased HCO3: The mild alkalosis may be secondary to vomiting and loss of gastric
acid. Blood gas measurement is needed to fully characterize the acid/base disorder in this
patient and is probably not necessary at this time.


Mildly increased ALP and phosphorus: As described in Chapter 2, there are numerous
nonspecific causes for increased ALP in dogs. In the context of the normal values for the
other liver enzymes, nonspecific induction or increases in the bone isoenzyme related to
skeletal growth in a young large breed dog should be considered. Increases in phosphorus
may also be seen in young, growing animals; however, decreased perfusion secondary to
blood loss could also contribute to this change.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Snickers’ parvo test was positive, and he was treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics
because of his compromised intestines and neutropenia. His electrolyte values rapidly
normalized, and his white blood cell numbers began to increase four days after hospitalization. He was released from the hospital on day 5 and had an uneventful recovery at home.
His sister never got sick.


Snicker’s case may be compared with Red Molly (Case 4), who also had non-selective protein
loss through the gut. This potential feature of gastrointestinal disease may be present with a
variety of pathologic processes in the gut, and is not diagnostic for any one disease. As
highlighted by comparison of these two cases, loss of protein may or may not be
accompanied by concurrent loss of erythrocytes, electrolytes, or fluid (water).


Case 7 – Level 2
“Susannah” is a 2-year-old spayed female domestic short haired cat who was adopted 3
months ago after being held as a stray in a veterinary clinic. Her physical examination and
blood work were unremarkable prior to adoption. For the last week, Susannah has had dark
stool and a decreased appetite. She has become progressively more lethargic for the past
three days, and she may be drinking more than usual lately. On physical examination,
Susannah is thin and has an unkempt haircoat. She has lost one pound of body weight, has
icteric mucous membranes, and is febrile. Susannah’s abdomen is distended and the kidneys
feel enlarged on palpation. She is feline leukemia virus negative.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Susannah has a neutrophilic leukocytosis with a slight left shift and toxic changes,
compatible with inflammation. The lymphopenia may be related to corticosteroid effects. She
also has a normocytic, normochromic, nonregenerative anemia that is most likely due to
inflammatory disease. However, since there is also thrombocytopenia, suppression of
production due to a primary bone marrow problem is possible. This seems less likely because
of the activity in the myeloid line. Increased consumption of platelets could be immunemediated or secondary to adhesion to activated or damaged endothelial cells. Hemorrhage
could cause both anemia and thrombocytopenia, and the black tarry stool is evidence of
melena. In general, blood loss anemias are regenerative, however concurrent inflammatory
disease could suppress marrow response. The prolonged coagulation times suggest the


potential for abnormal bleeding and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) as a
cause for increased platelet consumption. Detection of increased fibrin degradation products
would further support a diagnosis of DIC. Decreased liver function also may prolong
coagulation times.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: The increase in serum glucose is mild and likely attributable to stress.


Hypocalcemia with normal phosphorus: Low serum albumin explains the mild decrease in
calcium because of a decrease in the protein bound fraction in the blood. This is unlikely to
impact the biologically active ionized fraction and therefore should not cause clinical signs. If
clinical signs suggestive for hypocalcemia develop, ionized calcium should be measured.


Normal total protein with hypoalbuminemia and high-normal globulins: Hypoalbumiemia
could be due to decreased production and/or increased losses. The poor body condition
suggests that nutritional factors could impact albumin production in this case. Decreased
liver function could also be a contributor. Although no specific tests of liver function were
performed, low normal serum cholesterol, poorly concentrated urine, hyperbilirubinemia, and
prolonged coagulation times may all be associated with inadequate hepatic function. In
addition, albumin production in the liver may be downregulated in response to inflammation
(albumin is a negative acute phase reactant) or hyperglobulinemia (to maintain oncotic
pressure). Excessive losses of albumin in this patient may be accounted for by high protein
effusion in the abdomen and bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract. These two sources of
protein loss are non-specific and could lower the globulin concentration back into the
reference interval. Inflammation leading to a polyclonal gammopathy is most likely in
Susannah because of her age and leukogram data, however monoclonal gammopathies may
rarely be associated with inflammatory disease and must be distinguished from
paraneoplastic conditions associated with lymphoma or multiple myeloma.


Hypokalemia: Decreased intake associated with a poor nutritional plane and the potential for
increased losses via the GI tract or into the abdominal effusion account for the low serum
potassium. If Susannah is polyuric and polydipsic, increased renal tubular flow rates may be
leading to increased renal wastage of potassium as well.


Hyperbilirubinemia: Sepsis, liver disease, and hemolysis may be factors in causing increased
serum bilurubin. Abnormalities in the leukogram combined with fever and coagulation data
compatible with DIC could occur as a result of a septic process. The normal ALP and GGT
make cholestatic liver disease less likely, however decreased liver function is not always
associated with elevated liver enzymes (See Chapter 2). Given the anemia, a hemolytic
process is possible, however there are no morphologic abnormalities described such as
agglutination, Heinz bodies, spherocytes, schistocytes, etc, that would suggest a cause for
hemolysis. Also, given adequate time, hemolytic anemias are usually regenerative, in contrast
to the normocytic, normochromic anemia Susannah has at presentation. The increased serum
bilirubin explains the bilirubinuria and crystals in the urine.
