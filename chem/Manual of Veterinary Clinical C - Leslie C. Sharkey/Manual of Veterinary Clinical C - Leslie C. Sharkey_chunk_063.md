Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypocalcemia: Hypocalcemia with normophosphatemia may be associated with hypoalbuminemia, which is present in this case. Darla is spayed, so pregnancy and lactation are not
affecting calcium metabolism, nor is there evidence of pancreatic or gastrointestinal disease.


Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia and low-normal globulins: Low protein values are
associated with both increased losses and decreased production. In this case, we are already
suspicious of blood loss. There is no evidence of other routes of protein loss such as third
space fluid accumulation, skin lesions, or gastrointestinal disease at this time. Because serum
albumin is relatively lower than serum globulin levels, selective glomerular loss of albumin is
possible. A urinalysis could be performed to quantify protein loss in the urine, however this
test will not distinguish proteinuria due to glomerular lesions from protein associated with
hematuria originating in other parts of the urinary tract. In these cases, it is often most
practical to manage the hematuria prior to attempting to document protein losing
nephropathy. Decreased production of protein, predominantly albumin, can be the result of
starvation but requires prolonged or severe food deprivation and poor body condition would
be evident. Liver failure may also result in decreased synthesis of albumin. Although two liver
enzymes are elevated, most analytes on the routine clinical chemistry panel that reflect liver
function appear to be within reference intervals (BUN, glucose, and cholesterol). Because


these analytes are neither sensitive nor specific indicators of liver function, serum bile acids
or blood ammonia measurements should be performed in patients with suspected liver
failure. Albumin is a negative acute phase reactant, and its production may be
downregulated as part of the inflammatory response. However, there is no evidence of
inflammation on the CBC.


Hyponatremia with proportional hypochloridemia: Both increased losses and dilution are
likely factors contributing to low serum sodium and chloride. Hemorrhage results in loss of
electrolytes proportional to the loss of fluid. Like the fall in PCV and total protein,
hyponatremia and hypochloridemia often follow hemorrhage as fluid losses are replaced with
water by drinking and as hypotension results in the retention of free water by the kidney due
to the action of antidiuretic hormone. Similar mechanisms also may occur when fluids are lost
via the gastrointestinal tract, skin, kidney, or into third spaces. Retention of free water can
dilute sodium and chloride during pregnancy or congestive heart failure, while the osmotic
effects of hyperglycemia can draw water into the circulation from the extravascular space in
diabetic patients. Low sodium and chloride are rarely the result of dietary deficiency in small
animal patients on commercial diets, even if there is a history of anorexia.


Hypokalemia: The mechanism for Darla’s hypokalemia is likely the same as for the
abnormalities in sodium and chloride. There is loss of potassium due to hemorrhage with
dilution of remaining electrolyte as water accumulates to compensate for the resultant
hypovolemia. Inadequate intake of potassium during periods of anorexia may exacerbate
hypokalemia.


Increased HCO3: Alkalemia may be associated with the hyperventilation as excessive carbon
dioxide is lost when Darla increases her respiratory rate to compensate for the developing
anemia and hypoxia.


Mildly increased ALP: There are many extrahepatic causes for increased ALP in the dog,
including corticosteroid effects which are suggested by the lymphopenia. This abnormality is
mild and not accompanied by a change in GGT, so a thorough medication history should be
taken to rule out drug induction. Other considerations include bone disease,
endocrinopathies, and cholestatic liver disease. Liver disease is unlikely with the normal GGT
and bilirubin. This analyte should be re-evaluated and further work-up is indicated if the
increases are persistent or increasing over time. Chapter 2 may be consulted for a complete
discussion of hepatic and extrahepatic causes of increased ALP.


Increased ALT: ALT generally suggests hepatocellular damage, but does not indicate cause.
In Darla’s case, hypoperfusion or poor oxygenation of the liver should be considered as a
potential cause for hepatocyte damage. Because the ALP also is elevated, primary liver
disease cannot be ruled out. Repeat serum biochemical profile after Darla’s anemia is
addressed will help determine the appropriate clinical course.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

The combination of hematuria and hematoma formation at the venipuncture site was
considered evidence of coagulopathy, which was confirmed by prolonged prothrombin (PT)
and partial thromboplastin times (APTT). After further questioning of the owner it was
discovered that Darla had consumed an anticoagulant rodenticide, so she was treated with a
plasma transfusion and vitamin K. She was discharged when her clotting times normalized
and had an uneventful recovery at home.


Darla developed electrolyte abnormalities because she had been losing isotonic fluids
through hemorrhage and replacing them with water, a hypotonic fluid.


Case 11 – Level 2
“Isis” is an 8-year-old spayed female domestic short-haired cat. She was hit by a car 10 days
ago and experienced a degloving wound of the right front limb. She has been hospitalized
for wound management and is being treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Today,
she has tachypnea with harsh lung sounds and tachycardia with a gallop rhythm. On
radiographs, Isis has an enlarged liver, cardiomegaly, and pulmonary edema, compatible with
congestive heart failure. She began treatment with furosemide earlier in the day, when the
doctors noted her tachypnea and harsh lung sounds.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Isis has a neutrophilic leukocytosis compatible with inflammation from the leg wound.
She also has a microcytic, hypochromic anemia that may be related to chronic blood loss and
iron deficiency from the degloving wound.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: The increased serum glucose is attributed to pain and/or stress.


Hypophosphatemia: The increased HCO3 and alkalosis are contributing to an intracellular
shift of serum phosphorus. Primary hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia of malignancy
may also cause hypophosphatemia, however these conditions generally are associated with
hypercalcemia, while Isis has hypocalcemia.


Hypocalcemia: Hypocalcemia is frequently associated with low serum albumin, which is not
the case here. There is no evidence of renal disease, nor does hypoparathyroidism seem
likely with the low serum phosphorus. Cats receiving infusions of bicarbonate or treatment
with diuretics such as furosemide can develop hypocalcemia. These treatments may result in
a failure to develop a sodium gradient that is adequate to drive passive reabsorption of
calcium in the ascending limb of the renal tubule.


Hyponatremia with disproportionate hypochloremia: If the chloride is corrected for the
degree of hyponatremia (82 x 146/132), it becomes 90.7, still significantly below the
reference interval. Increased losses of sodium and chloride may be occurring through the skin
because of the degloving injury. Because diuretic therapy is being used, further sodium
wasting may occur in the kidney. In circumstances characterized by renal hypoperfusion such
as congestive heart failure, total body sodium may increase because activation of the reninangiotensin system stimulates increased proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium and water.
Because of this, less fluid arrives at the distal parts of the tubule responsible for free water
excretion. In addition, non-osmotic stimulation of antidiuretic hormone release further impairs
water excretion, leading to dilution of electrolytes in the plasma. Diuretics like furosemide
inhibit chloride reabsorption and can slightly increase bicarbonate as well. Hypochloremia is
associated with alkalosis.


Hypokalemia: If Isis has a poor appetite, decreased intake may compound increased losses
associated with renin-angiotensin system activation. Inadequate delivery of sodium to the
distal tubule can predispose to kaliuresis, and diuretic use will exacerbate renal losses of
potassium. The diuretic effect may be worse in cats than other species and is more
pronounced if electrolyte intake is decreased because of anorexia.


Increased HCO3 (alkalemia): The effects of the diuretic therapy and chloride depletion
contribute to the increased HCO3. Because of the potential for concurrent respiratory issues in
this patient, a blood gas analysis may provide further information about the acid/base status.


Increased AST: This abnormality is mild and probably reflects tissue damage associated with
perfusion deficits.


Hyperamylasemia: Increased serum amylase in this case is attributed to decreased
glomerular filtration rate. Concurrent pancreatic disease cannot be ruled out, however
amylase is not a good indicator of pancreatitis in cats.


###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Intravenous fluid treatment was discontinued and Isis was treated with diuretics to correct the
fluid load that was thought to have precipitated the congestive heart failure. She responded
well and ultimately recovered from her wound. Various diuretics influence electrolyte
homeostasis (See Snow, Chapter 7, Case 7), so the specific medication should be chosen
carefully and serum electrolyte values should be monitored.


This case is similar to Darla (Chapter 7, Case 10), who was experiencing isotonic fluid losses
that were replaced with water, leading to low serum electrolyte concentrations. Isis’s
electrolyte abnormalities were further complicated by intravascular volume expansion due to
iatrogenic fluid overload and secondary heart failure.


Case 12 – Level 2
“Weasel” is a 10-year-old neutered male Collie dog presenting with a 4 month history of
hematuria. Four months ago, he had an initial episode of hematuria that cleared after two
cycles of antibiotic treatment. At that time, abdominal radiographs were unremarkable. Two
months ago, the hematuria recurred but did not resolve despite prolonged antibiotic therapy.
Four days ago, Weasel was presented for further work up for the hematuria. The owners
noted that Weasel does not appear to strain, but will urinate, move a few feet, and then
urinate a smaller amount which is usually bloodier than the initial urine. He seems to be
urinating at the same frequency as he always has. Other than the hematuria, he seemed to
be normal and healthy. On physical examination, Weasel appeared well hydrated with normal
vital signs and auscultation. However, he was tense on abdominal palpation, and abdominal
ultrasound revealed a mass along the ventral aspect of the bladder wall close to the neck.
Surgical removal of the mass was scheduled for the following week. However, Weasel’s
condition deteriorated over the past 4 days, and he returned to the hospital due to lethargy,
vomiting, anorexia, straining to urinate and abdominal distension. On this presentation,
Weasel is depressed and weak, and there is melena on rectal examination.

Abdominal fluid analysis
Appearance: Red and turbid
Total nucleated cell count: 8,900 cells/µl
Total protein: <2.5 g/dl
Description: Smears contain small numbers of erythrocytes. The
predominant nucleated cell is a nondegenerate neutrophil, which occurs
with smaller numbers of large mononuclear cells and reactive
mesothelial cells.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Weasel has a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis and a lymphopenia compatible with a
corticosteroid leukogram.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Both endogeneous and exogenous corticosteroids can cause hyperglycemia.
Diabetes mellitus should also be considered. Diabetic patients may present with signs of
urinary tract disease because of polyuria/polydipsia or concurrent urinary tract infections,
however the degree of hyperglycemia is mild at this time.


Marked azotemia: Azotemia should be classified as pre-renal, renal, or post-renal, however a
urine specific gravity was not reported in this case. A pre-renal component to the azotemia
cannot be ruled out at this point, however the clinical history does not include a clear
evaluation of the hydration status. Other indications of dehydration such as polycythemia and
hyperproteinemia are not present. Renal failure is possible, however the presence of a mass in
the urinary bladder suggests a post-renal cause for azotemia. The recent onset of abdominal
distention could be compatible with a ruptured urinary bladder. Weasel has melena and
digestion of blood in the intestinal track that may contribute to a mild increase in BUN.


Hyperphosphatemia: This abnormality is due to failure of elimination of phosphorus in the
kidney.


Hypermagnesemia: Like phosphorus, retention of magnesium is attributed to failure of
elimination through the kidney.
