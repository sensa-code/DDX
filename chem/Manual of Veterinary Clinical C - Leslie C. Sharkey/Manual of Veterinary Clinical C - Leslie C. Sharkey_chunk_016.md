###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: Freeze has a leucopenia with a mild lymphopenia, which could be compatible with
a corticosteroid response. With the history of fever in a very young patient, acute viral infection
with lympholysis is a differential.


Erythrogram: The hematocrit is just below the reference range. Because the reference range
was not generated in the laboratory in which the patient values were generated, small


deviations from the reference range are difficult to interpret. Crias have been noted to have a
“physiologic anemia” after birth, which could be the result of shortened fetal red blood cell
lifespan, decreased stimulus for erythrocyte production, and high blood oxygen affinity (Adams).
The clinical interpretation of this value is unclear at this time, however any further decrement in
this value could be important. The mild increase in MCHC also may be related to generation of
reference intervals, however, intravascular or in vitro hemolysis may contribute.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Marked hypoglycemia: In the context of the clinical history of seizures, this value is likely
accurate, however verification to rule out laboratory error is always appropriate. Because the
patient is also febrile, sepsis is a primary differential diagnosis for hypoglycemia. Liver failure
can result in impaired gluconeogenesis, and portovascular anomalies have been reported in
alpaca crias (Ivany). Elevations in serum bilirubin and GGT support hepatic pathology. Serum
bile acids and blood ammonia can be evaluated to assess liver function. Ill or anorexic
neonates of many species are predisposed to the development of hypoglycemia, possibly due
to limited energy reserves or immaturity of gluconeogenic systems (Lawler). This appears to
be less common in camelids, who often develop hyperglycemia when stressed in the neonatal
period (Cebra). Mechanistically, adult llamas and alpacas appear to have a weak insulin
response and slow cellular uptake of glucose that promotes hyperglycemia (Cebra et al).


Increased BUN and creatinine: Based on the clinical history, fluid intake is likely to have
been low since birth, and pre-renal azotemia is suspected. Interpretation of the azotemia
should be done in concert with urinalysis; however urine specific gravity is often low in
animals on an all milk diet (Adams).


Hyperbilirubinemia: Hemolysis, liver disease, and sepsis are all possible contributors to this
abnormality. The patient has clinical signs or laboratory abnormalities that could be compatible
with all three causes, so a single precipitating factor cannot be identified at this time.


Elevated serum GGT: In adult ruminants and camelids, increased serum GGT is an indicator
of hepatic pathology. In some species serum GGT activity may increase in neonatal animals
because colostrum contains large amounts of GGT, which is absorbed through the neonatal
gut. In calves and lambs, but not crias, serum GGT has been advocated as an indicator of
passive transfer status (Johnston, Tessman). In this case, the concurrent hyperbilirubinemia
indicates that liver disease should not be dismissed at this point.


Elevated AST and CK: These increases likely reflect muscle damage secondary to the seizure
activity.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Freeze was treated with diazepam and phenobarbital for the seizures. Antibiotic and fluid
therapy was continued, along with nasogastric feedings. Over the next few days the enzyme
values normalized, the azotemia resolved, and the cria was normoglycemic. Both blood
ammonia and serum bile acid tests were normal, suggesting normal liver function. Her
increased liver enzyme values at the time of admission are interpreted to be associated with
poor perfusion/hypoxia and endotoxemia. The specific cause of the hypoglycemic episode
could not be determined, however sepsis was considered to be the most likely cause. Blood
and urine cultures could have been performed, although previous therapy with antibiotics
would likely have suppressed bacterial growth. Freeze was nursing well, gaining weight, and
had no further signs of neurologic disease at the time of discharge.

GI Case 9 – Level 2
“Maya” is a 6-month-old intact female DSH cat that was obtained by the owners from a family
friend. One week ago, the owners noticed that Maya was lethargic, and last night she stopped
eating and drinking. Today, they found Maya limp on the kitchen floor. Maya is an exclusively
indoor cat, but is unvaccinated. She lives with another indoor cat who has been vaccinated.
On physical examination, Maya is very depressed, is recumbent, and has dry mucous
membranes. She has watery yellow stool around her rectum, and vomits a large amount of
clear, brown-tinged fluid. Her peripheral pulses are weak and she is hypothermic. A jugular
catheter is placed for fluid therapy, and there is greater than expected bleeding from the
catheterization site. Her body condition is adequate and FeLV/FIV tests are negative.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Maya’s leukogram is characterized by a severe leucopenia (Figure 3-4). Too few leukocytes
were present on the blood film for an accurate differential cell count, however a severe
neutropenia is present. A normocytic, normochromic anemia is present. The anemia is more
severe than it appears to be because Maya is significantly dehydrated, and hemoconcentration
increases the hematocrit. Platelet numbers cannot be evaluated due to clumping.

Maya’s blood film showing severe
leucopenia. B. Similar field from a
cat with a normal leukocyte count

Serum Biochemical Profile
Marked hypoglycemia: Artifactual hypoglycemia was ruled out by confirming appropriate
collection and processing of the sample. The hypoglycemia is severe enough to result in
clinical signs, which could include mental dullness or seizures. In combination with the severe
neutropenia, sepsis is an important differential diagnosis for the hypoglycemia in this patient.
Maya is too young to prioritize neoplasia, and her good body condition makes starvation
unlikely. Inadequate gluconeogenesis secondary to liver failure is possible since no specific
tests of liver function have been performed and Maya is hypoalbuminemic, hyperbilirubinemic, has low normal serum cholesterol, and has abnormal bleeding secondary to catheter
placement. Abnormal bleeding may alternatively be explained by diminished platelet
function associated with hypothermia, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).


Hypocalcemia: Because of extensive binding of calcium to albumin, low total calcium levels
in the blood may be explained by hypoalbuminemia. Correction formulas have been


developed for the dog, but are not applicable to the cat. Low total calcium caused by
hypoproteinemia is not typically associated with clinical signs of hypocalcemia, however if
there is any question, the biologically active ionized fraction of calcium should be
determined.


Panhypoproteinemia: Low levels of both albumin and globulin proteins indicate plasma loss.
Hemorrhage is a common cause, however Maya has no history of external blood loss. Plasma
may also be lost via exudation or extravasation through compromised gut wall and skin or in
association with parasitism. In Maya’s case, increased capillary permeability associated with
endotoxemia or gastrointestinal losses seem most likely. (See Chapter 4 for further discussion
of abnormalities in protein)


Mild hyponatremia: Hyponatremia in dehydrated patients is often attributable to increased
losses, especially if combined with hypotonic fluid replacement by drinking water. Maya is
likely to have lost sodium through her compromised gastrointestinal tract, however other
sources of loss include third space, renal, and cutaneous losses.


Mild hypokalemia: As with sodium, gastrointestinal losses of potassium are likely to
contribute to the hypokalemia. Decreased intake also may be a factor in anorectic patients.
Like sodium, potassium may be lost into effusions or through the kidney or skin. Transcellular
shifts in patients with acid/base disorders also may influence serum potassium levels, but
Maya’s HCO3 is within the reference interval at this time. Arterial blood gas is required for
full assessment of acid/base status in any patient.


Mild hyperbilirubinemia: Increased bilirubin often reflects inadequate uptake of bilirubin by
hepatocytes, and is most often associated with liver disease or hemolysis. Although Maya is
mildly anemic, no icterus or hemolysis are noted on examination of her plasma that would
support significant hemolysis. All liver enzymes are within reference range, however liver
enzyme levels are not adequate tests of liver function, and serum bile acid determinations
are required for further evaluation of hepatic function. As indicated in the interpretation of
hypoglycemia, the low albumin and cholesterol could be compatible with decreased liver
function, however the predominance of clinical and laboratory data suggest endotoxemia as
the cause for the hyperbilirubinemia. Endotoxin decreases hepatocellular uptake of bilirubin,
and may cause mild to moderate hyperbilirubinemia.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Because of Maya’s clinical signs, unvaccinated status, and profound leukopenia, feline
panleukopenia was suspected. A canine parvo test was positive, and she was treated with
intravenous fluids and crystalloids and placed in an incubator. Dopamine was administered to
support blood pressure, and she was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Unfortunately,
despite aggressive therapy, Maya died the next day.


Feline panleukopenia is characterized by damage to the intestinal villi, resulting in
malabsorptive diarrhea and increased permeability of the gut wall. Viral replication in
hematopoietic tissues causes leukopenia, which is often profound and parallels the severity of
clinical disease. The combination of intestinal compromise and leukopenia leads to secondary
bacteremia and endotoxemia and is rapidly fatal. Disseminated intravascular coagulation may
occur secondary to sepsis, although cats are less likely to have clinically detectable abnormal
bleeding than dogs with similar laboratory parameters. Blood clotting is also impaired when
the body temperature is low. The cause for the bleeding around the catheterization site was
not resolved because coagulation testing was not performed in this patient.


Both Freeze (Chapter 3, Case 8) and Maya have histories of febrile illness, hypoglycemia, and
hyperbilirubinemia, although Maya’s clinical presentation and laboratory data more clearly
indicate sepsis. In contrast, Freeze appeared to have had a less severe illness with resultant
better outcome. Both sepsis and liver disease can cause hyperbilirubinemia. Both may occur
simultaneously in the patient, in which case it may not be possible to determine which is the
major contributor to the increased bilirubin levels in the blood. See Chapter 2 Case 9 (dog),
Chapter 2 Case 14 (llama), and Chapter 2 Case 21 (dog).

“Bursley” is a 4-year-old intact male Pit Bull presenting with a 2 month history of progressive
behavioral changes consisting of aggression (grumpy when moved), dull attitude, hypodypsia,
and poor appetite associated with weight loss of 15 pounds. On presentation, Bursley is
depressed, and he appears to fall asleep while standing up. He has a thin hair coat over the
dorsal midline, and his testicles are reduced in size. Bursley has bilaterally depressed conscious
proprioceptive deficits in both the front and the rear. His pulse is 48 beats per minute with no
