###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: Neutrophilic leukocytosis with a regenerative left shift and monocytosis. The left
shift indicates significant inflammation, which could also explain the monocytosis. Sources of
inflammation in this patient include immune-mediated hemolytic anemia and possible liver
lesions.


Erythrogram: Severe anemia. Agglutination precludes reporting of indices to characterize
the anemia, however the presence of anisocytosis and polychromasia suggests some degree
of regeneration. A reticulocyte count should be performed to quantitate the response. The
nucleated red blood cells are likely part of the regenerative response. However, hypoxic
damage to the endothelial cells of the bone marrow and spleen could impair the ability of
these organs to regulate the passage of only mature cells into the circulation.


Platelets: A mild thrombocytopenia is present, but is not of the degree expected to result in
spontaneous bleeding in the absence of other pathology. Inflammation and early
disseminated intravascular coagulation could contribute to decreased platelets through
increased consumption. Immune-mediated destruction is possible as well. As many as one
third to one half of dogs with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia also have immunemediated thrombocytopenia.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Increased BUN: The cause of the azotemia needs to be determined as prerenal, renal, or
postrenal. Creatinine cannot be reported to assist in interpretation because high bilirubin
interferes with the creatinine reaction, causing a falsely low result. A prerenal component
seems likely. The urine is somewhat concentrated. However, since there is no evaluation of
hydration status, it is difficult to tell if the urine should be expected to be maximally
concentrated (e.g. specific gravity greater than 1.030).


Hypoproteinemia with hypoglobulinemia: The cause for this is unclear, since significant
inflammation would be expected to increase globulins through increased production of both
immunoglobulins and acute phase reactants. Widespread inflammation could lead to
increased capillary permeability and loss of protein into the interstitium. (See Chapter 4 for
more information on evaluation of proteins)


Severe hyperbilirubinemia: The data on this patient suggest hemolysis as the cause for the
hyperbilirubinemia. The severe, likely regenerative anemia with relatively mild increases in
ALP make cholestasis a less likely etiology for this abnormality. A reticulocyte count may be
performed to quantitate the regenerative response, but because it takes several days after an
acute hemolytic event for the bone marrow to start releasing increased numbers of
reticulocytes, a significant reticulocytosis may not initially be detected.


Mild increase in ALP: An approximately 2 fold elevation in ALP can be difficult to interpret in
canine patients. In the absence endocrinopathies or a history of the use of medications that
induce ALP production, hepatic hypoxia seems the most likely cause for this elevation.


Mild to moderate increases in ALT and AST: The 4-5 fold increases in hepatocellular
enzymes are slightly greater than the elevation noted for ALP. Given the clinical history, a
contributing cause for the hepatocellular damage is hypoxia of the hepatocytes along with
ischemic liver lesions that are often described in patients with immune-mediated hemolytic
anemia.


Coagulation Panel: The combination of >20 µg/ml FDPs and the thrombocytopenia indicates
that this patient is at risk for the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Although only PT is mildly prolonged at this time, coagulation times should be monitored.
Liver disease may be associated with increased FDPs because of impaired hepatic clearance.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Immune mediated hemolytic anemia with secondary liver enzyme elevations due to hepatic
hypoxia.


Rocky had a degree of hyperbilirubinemia comparable to Patton (Case 8), however Rocky
also had severe anemia and mildly increased ALP indicating that hemolysis rather than
cholestasis caused the hyperbilirubinemia. In patients with immune-mediated hemolytic
anemia, hyperbilirubinemia exceeding 5 mg/dL has been shown to correlate with a less
favorable prognosis and is associated with increased risk for thrombosis (Carr). Increased ALP
has also been shown to be a risk factor for thromboembolic complications (Johnson), which
are common in patients with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia. There were slightly greater
elevations in hepatocellular enzymes than cholestatic indicators, but compared to the
previous cases (Lady and Patton, Cases 7 and 8), it is more difficult this time to determine
whether hepatocellular damage or cholestasis is the predominant pattern due to concurrent
hemolysis. Hemorrhagic, ischemic, and cholestatic liver lesions have been demonstrated in
necropsy studies of dogs with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, and these lesions were
more severe in patients with higher bilirubin levels (McManus).


This patient was Coombs test positive at 1+, and received a blood transfusion along with
corticosteroids, azothiaprine, gastroprotectants, and intravenous fluids. Rocky was released
from the hospital with a guarded to poor prognosis. He did well at home for 2 weeks, at
which point he returned to the hospital with decreased appetite. He was icteric with marked
hepatosplenomegaly, had a heart murmur and had increased respiratory effort. He stabilized
over night in the intensive care unit, but by the next morning, he had profuse abdominal
effusion that was characterized as a septic suppurative exudate and was euthanized. At
necropsy, the liver showed evidence of steroid hepatopathy. In addition, Rocky had severe
membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and hemoglobin nephropathy secondary to the
immune-mediated hemolytic anemia.

Liver Case 14 – Level 2
“Peach” is a 10-year-old male llama that presented for evaluation of facial pruritis and
dermatitis. This was reported after the llama was turned out onto new pasture. Physical
examination revealed bilateral suppurative excoriation of the bases of both ears, a crusted
hyperkeratotic muzzle, bilateral chemosis with severe mucopurulent conjunctivitis, and severe
generalized facial edema. The remainder of the physical was unremarkable, except the llama
had a somewhat low body condition score.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Neutrophilic leukocytosis with monocytosis and increased fibrinogen indicate
inflammation, which is compatible with the described facial lesions.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Stress is a likely cause for hyperglycemia in this llama, although it should be
appreciated that camelids have low circulating baseline insulin levels and a poor pancreatic


response to hyperglycemia (Cebra 2001). Some authors recommend relatively more
aggressive monitoring and treatment of hyperglycemia in llamas than in other species due to
this physiological limitation (Cebra 2000).


Hyperproteinemia with hyperglobulinemia: As discussed in the CBC results, these findings
are most compatible with inflammation. Both immunoglobulins and acute phase reactants
can contribute to increased globulins. Mechanisms are discussed in Chapter 4. In patients
with inflammatory disease the increase in globulins is usually polyclonal, reflecting enhanced
production of multiple types of proteins. The albumin is at the low end of the reference
range, though not technically abnormal at this time. Decreased liver function could depress
production, and there is some evidence in other species that albumin is a negative acute
phase reactant. Alternatively, albumin may be lost via the exudative skin lesions in this
patient, or may be associated with a chronically poor nutritional status.


Hyperbilirubinemia: There are several potential etiologies for the mild hyperbilirubinemia in
this case. Causes for increased serum bilirubin include hemolysis, cholestasis, decreased liver
function, and sepsis. Hemolysis cannot be completely ruled out in this patient, however the
serum was not hemolyzed and the PCV is in the low normal range. Cholestasis and
decreased liver function are possible, although no specific tests of liver function have been
performed on this patient. The neutrophilic leukocytosis could indicate a septic process, but
is not specific for infectious disease, but rather indicates inflammation. The presence of a
septic process was later confirmed.


Increased AST, SDH, ALP and GGT: Increased AST and SDH with normal CK is most
compatible with hepatocellular damage. ALP and GGT will increase with hepatobiliary
disease, including cholestasis. While the increase in GGT is most remarkable, it is difficult to
determine what process is predominating in this patient based on the laboratory data
presented here.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Hepatobiliary disease with inflammation and hyperglycemia


A liver biopsy was performed to help achieve a specific diagnosis and prognosis in this
patient. Sections of liver tissue were characterized by mild to moderate portal fibrosis with
mild infiltrates of lymphocytes and plasma cells as well as scattered neutrophils. Three punch
biopsies of the dermal lesions revealed epidermal ulceration, intra-epidermal pustules and
severe superficial pyoderma compatible with a bacterial etiology. Peach was treated with
intravenous antibiotics, corticosteroids to reduce inflammation in the face, Banamine [®] for
pain management, and a keratolytic antimicrobial shampoo. Within 24 hours the facial edema
resolved and the patient was comfortable and resumed eating. Peach was discharged, but
died 2 weeks later. At necropsy, persistent pyoderma was noted. In addition, there were 2-3
gallons of peritoneal fluid accompanied by variably-sized, white nodules that were scattered
throughout the liver, kidney, pericardium, and pleura. There was serous atrophy of pericardial
fat, and the pericardium contained 1 mm diameter white nodes and areas were thickened
and rough. Small white foci were occasionally noted throughout the pleura. On histologic
examination, the white nodules were embolic foci of intense suppurative inflammation that
were often centered on blood vessels. The lesions in the heart and kidney were thought to
be the cause of death, and that the primary septic focus was the skin lesions.


For this patient, hepatitis due to disseminated bacterial infection was the likely cause of the
laboratory abnormalities. Hepatic disease in camelids is often a consequence of malnutrition


or metabolic disorders, which could also have contributed in this case, given the poor body
condition of the animal. Other causes of liver disease that have been reported for llamas are
similar to those for other species and include lipidosis, toxicity, and neoplasia.


As for other species, liver biopsy is often required for a specific diagnosis of hepatobiliary
disease. While the collection of percutaneous biopsy specimens has been shown to be safe in
camelids with minimal subsequent changes in clinical laboratory parameters (Anderson), it is
unclear how well diagnoses based on these small biopsy specimens correlate with samples
collected during abdominal exploratory or at necropsy. In small animal patients, there is
some evidence that significant discordance between diagnoses exists depending on the
method of biopsy collection, possibly due to sampling bias (Cole). That may be why the
original biopsy sample did not reveal the systemic bacterial infection apparent at necropsy,
although it cannot be determined if that process was present at the time of biopsy or
developed after discharge.

Liver Case 15 – Level 3
“Stella” is a nine-year-old miniature mare who presented for weakness, depression, and colic.
Her mucous membranes are pale and yellow, she has weak pulses, and rapid shallow
breathing. She is thin, with poor body condition. Owners report that she has been anorexic
and has lost weight since foaling several days ago. The owner noted passage of brown urine
before Stella was led to the trailer for transport to the hospital. No feces have been found in
her stall for 2 days, but she has normal gut sounds in all four quadrants.
