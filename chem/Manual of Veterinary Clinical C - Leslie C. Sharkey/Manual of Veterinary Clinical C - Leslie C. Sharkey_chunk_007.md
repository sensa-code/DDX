###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Data are not available on this patient.


Serum Biochemistry Profile
Decreased BUN with normal serum creatinine: This could be compatible with decreased
production secondary to diminished liver function or, less likely, starvation. Given the
isosthenuria, diuresis could contribute.


Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia: In combination with the low BUN, decreased
hepatic production of albumin is the most likely cause of the hypoalbuminemia.
Starvation/protein malnutrition also should be considered a differential diagnosis. Other


differentials for hypoalbuminemia include excessive losses through such routes as the kidney,
gastrointestinal tract, or exudative skin lesions. The history and physical examination do not
include significant cutaneous losses or diarrhea, and the urine protein is negative. Neither is
hemorrhage described, although a packed cell volume is needed to help rule out
hemorrhage. Loss of protein through hemorrhage, exudative cutaneous lesions, or the
gastrointestinal tract generally include loss of both albumin and globulins, which does not
appear to be the case here. It should be noted that many hepatic diseases in cats are
associated with an acute phase reaction, resulting in increased globulins. Hepatic lipidosis is
an exception and is often not associated with hyperglobulinemia (Center).


Hypocalcemia: The hypocalcemia is likely secondary to the hypoalbuminemia (see Chapter 6).
Formulas to correct total serum calcium for the degree of hypoalbuminemia have been
derived for the normal dog, but have not been validated for use in healthy or ill cats.


Increased ALP (12x), normal GGT: Although the bilirubin value was not valid due to the
lipemia, the finding of icteric mucous membranes, bilirubin in the urine, and increased ALP
suggest cholestasis. The 12-fold increase in ALP in Squid is very significant. Because of lower
tissue concentrations and shorter half-life of ALP in the cat, even elevations as little as 2-3
fold are considered an important indicator of cholestasis. Enzyme induction is less common in
cats, and there is no history of this patient receiving any medications. A packed cell volume
would help rule out a hemolytic component to the icterus. Most liver diseases in cats cause
elevation of both ALP and GGT, with the exception of hepatic lipidosis in which ALP may
disproportionately increase compared to GGT. Based on these enzyme levels, hepatic
lipidosis should be a primary differential diagnosis in this patient. Because hepatic lipidosis
may be a primary or secondary disorder, the patient should be thoroughly evaluated for any
other underlying diseases.


Increased ALT and AST: The mild, 2-fold increase in these enzymes indicates that some
degree of hepatocellular damage is occurring.


Hypertriglyceridemia: Triglyceride concentrations are variable in hepatic lipidosis.
Mobilization of peripheral fat stores to the liver and inadequate liver processing of lipid can
increase triglyceride concentration in the blood.


Urinalysis: Squid is isosthenuric. As mentioned in the previous case (Dervish, Case 10), liver
disease may be associated with polyuria and polydipsia, and subsequently poorly
concentrated urine. Primary impaired renal concentrating ability also is possible and further
assessment is warranted. Unlike in dogs, bilirubin is not detected in urine from normal cats.
As indicated above, the presence of bilirubin in the urine is due to hyperbilirubinuria. Only
conjugated bilirubin passes the glomerular filter.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Feline hepatic lipidosis


Similar to Dervish’s blood work (Case 10), Squid’s results suggest a combination of
cholestasis, hepatocellular damage, and decreased liver function. As noted above, the high
ALP and normal GGT should prioritize a diagnosis of hepatic lipidosis in this case. This
interpretation is further supported in Squid’s case by the hepatomegaly and a history of
anorexia and weight loss. Liver biopsy or cytology is required to confirm the impression given
by the blood work. Both are adequate tests to detect markedly vacuolated hepatocytes
compatible with hepatic lipidosis, but biopsy is the preferred procedure for ruling out
concurrent diseases that may trigger secondary hepatic lipidosis. Because liver disease is a


common cause of coagulopathies in the cat and because several results here (low BUN,
hypoalbuminemia, and icterus) suggest the potential for decreased liver function, coagulation
studies should be performed prior to any invasive procedures, and prophylactic vitamin K
therapy should be considered. Liver function tests such as ammonia or bile acids are not
likely to alter clinical management and are not a high priority in hepatic lipidosis patients that
are icteric (Griffin).


Squid received vitamin K prior to aspiration of her liver. Cytology of her liver was consistent
with hepatic lipidosis and characterized by sheets of hepatocytes distorted by the presence
of numerous, small to large-sized, discrete cytoplasmic vacuoles (see Figure 2-5). Bile
pigment was present intracellularly and between cells, forming bile plugs. Numerous
erythrocytes and lipid vacuoles with scattered leukocytes were present in the background.
Squid was discharged with a feeding tube. She did well at home and recovered uneventfully.

Liver Case 12 – Level 2
“Binar” is a 1.5-year-old castrated male tabby cat with copper eyes. He is an indoor cat and
is up to date on all vaccinations. There are no other pets in the household. Binar presents
with seizures that are refractory to treatment with intravenous valium. Following collection of
blood samples, he is placed under general anesthesia for control of seizure activity. When he
recovers from general anesthesia, he shows a variety of neurologic signs including mental
dullness, head pressing, stumbling, and hypermetria. The owners are not aware of any access
to toxins. The physical exam is otherwise normal.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: No abnormalities.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Decreased BUN and Creatinine: Considering the concurrently low serum albumin and
neurologic signs, BUN may be decreased secondary to impaired production with hepatic
insufficiency in this patient. Dietary protein restriction also may lower BUN. Diuresis is
frequently a cause of a decreased serum creatinine. However, a low serum creatinine also
may be seen in thin animals with poor muscle mass such as may occur with malnutrition or
cachexia.


Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia and hypoglobulinemia: Considering the low BUN
and creatinine and neurologic signs, decreased hepatic production of albumin should be
considered an important differential diagnosis, but it does not account for the border-line
low globulin level. As was pointed out for Squid (Case 11), liver disease in cats may be
associated with decreased albumin production, however hyperglobulinemia is a relatively
consistent feature. Low BUN and serum creatinine with hypoalbuminemia may also
characterize severe starvation accompanied by muscle wasting, but this is not suggested by
the clinical history, nor does it explain the hypoglobulinemia. Differentials for decreases in
both fractions of proteins (panhypoproteinemia) could include excessive losses through the
gastrointestinal tract or into body cavities, exudative cutaneous lesions, or hemorrhage. The
history does not include diarrhea or significant cutaneous losses. Urine protein data is not
available for Binar, so renal loss could not be assessed. There is no history of hemorrhage,
and the packed cell volume is within reference range.


Hypocalcemia: The hypocalcemia is likely secondary to the low albumin level in the blood
(see Chapter 6). Formulas to correct total serum calcium for the degree of hypoalbuminemia
have been derived for the normal dog, but have not been validated for use in healthy or ill
cats.


Minimal increases in ALT and AST: The history of seizures in this patient suggests that
transient hepatocellular hypoxia/hypoperfusion during the seizure could contribute to the
elevation of hepatocellular enzymes. In combination with the other laboratory abnormalities,
however, the potential for more significant primary liver disease should be considered.
Because the degree of elevation of ALT and AST is roughly proportional to the number of
hepatocytes injured and the severity of the injury, the mild elevations could suggest that
there is minimal hepatic mass present.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Portosystemic shunt


Postprandial bile acids were 54 µmol/L, supporting decreased liver function. A dye study
revealed a portoazygous shunt.


Binar’s case illustrates the possibility of marked liver disease in the absence of dramatic
enzyme elevations. This is in contrast to Dervish and Squid (Cases 10 and 11), both of whom
had decreased liver function associated with marked enzyme elevations and hyperbilirubinemia. This made the diagnosis of liver disease more obvious based only on routine
laboratory testing. Hepatic encephalopathy should be considered in any patient with signs of
diffuse cerebral disease, especially in young cats because idiopathic epilepsy is rare. There is
a possible association between congenital portovascular anomalies and copper colored eyes
in cats. A mild microcytic anemia is more consistently a feature of portosystemic shunts in the


dog than the cat. The same is true for ammonium urate crystalluria, polyuria/polydipsia, and
hypoalbuminemia, although Binar did have low serum protein. When present, liver enzyme
elevations are generally mild with portosystemic shunts, especially in cats. Fasting bile acids
and sometimes fasting ammonia will be within the reference range in some patients because
there may be sufficient functional hepatic mass to extract these substances from the blood
given adequate time. However postprandial bile acids are almost always significantly
elevated and are considered a good screening test for the disease. As noted in the
discussion of Dervish (Case 10), ammonia is the only toxin implicated in hepatic
encephalopathy that can be measured clinically, but sample handling requirements usually
limit its use in private practice.


Binar had a coil surgically placed in his shunt, which attenuated flow through the vessel and
improved his liver function. He was continued on medical management of his condition and
returned to the care of his referring veterinarian.


Liver Case 13 – Level 2
“Rocky” is an 8-year-old, neutered male Boxer, who was previously healthy and was not
being treated with any medications. Rocky’s owner was out of town for one week. When the
owner arrived home, Rocky was noted to be lethargic, and he became progressively more so
over the next 2 days. At this time, the owner noticed discolored urine. On presentation, the
dog is weak and collapses on entering the clinic. His mucous membranes are pale and yellow,
and his temperature is 102°. His pulse is 160/minute and bounding and an arrhythmia is
noted. Respirations are 44/minute.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: Neutrophilic leukocytosis with a regenerative left shift and monocytosis. The left
shift indicates significant inflammation, which could also explain the monocytosis. Sources of
inflammation in this patient include immune-mediated hemolytic anemia and possible liver
lesions.
