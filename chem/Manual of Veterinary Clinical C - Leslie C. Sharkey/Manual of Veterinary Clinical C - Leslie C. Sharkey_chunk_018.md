Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: All samples were processed appropriately, so laboratory error was ruled out.
The clinical information, inflammatory leukogram, and presence of DIC are compatible with
sepsis as a cause for the hypoglycemia. Considering the leukogram data, hypoadrenocorticism may also be a cause for Kazoo’s hypoglycemia. Corticosteroids from the adrenal gland
increase hepatic gluconeogenesis and decrease glucose uptake and utilization in peripheral
tissues. Consequently, hypoglycemia may result from inadequate corticosteroid production


due to inadequate hepatic gluconeogenesis and increased insulin sensitivity. The combination
of hypoglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypocholesterolemia, and prolonged coagulation times
are also compatible with decreased liver function, which should be evaluated by fasted and
post-prandial bile acid testing. The clinical history describes the patient as thin, and he has
probably not had normal food intake for awhile, so nutritional compromise could contribute
to hypoglycemia in this case as well, although this is a rarely a cause of low blood glucose.


Azotemia: Prerenal azotemia is likely because Kazoo is markedly dehydrated. A renal
component cannot be ruled out without a urine specific gravity.


Panhypoproteinemia: A proportional decrease in albumin and globulins suggests protein
loss via hemorrhage, cutaneous lesions, the gastrointestinal tract or third space loss.
Significant protein could be lost into the abdominal effusion in this patient, and a poor
nutritional plane and increased protein catabolism after surgery could complicate Kazoo’s
protein metabolism. Vigorous fluid resuscitation may exacerbate the hypoproteinemia. As
noted in the section on hypoglycemia, the combination of low glucose, albumin, cholesterol,
and prolonged coagulation times could reflect poor liver function. Starvation can contribute
to hypoalbuminemia, and may be an issue in this case relative to poor body condition and a
period of anorexia.


Moderately increased AST: Because this enzyme is present in multiple tissues, the
interpretation of increased AST can be unclear. Because the ALT is within the reference
interval, elevated AST is best interpreted here as a potential indicator of muscle damage.
Muscle damage is likely secondary to the poor perfusion status of this animal. Increased AST
could also be iatrogenic and related to invasive procedures like surgery, however serum AST
levels would be expected to normalize several days after the procedure. Measurement of
creatine kinase (CK) could help confirm muscle origin for AST, but this information is not
critical to the diagnosis for this patient. Because Kazoo has multiple laboratory abnormalities
that are compatible with diminished liver function, hepatocellular damage also could increase
the AST. Generally, hepatocellular damage is accompanied by increases in ALT, however
patients with decreased liver function may have too few remaining hepatocytes to release
sufficient enzyme to elevate serum levels, or appreciable hepatocellular damage may no
longer be occurring (i.e. port-systemic shunts or cirrhosis). Please see Chapter 2 on liver
enzymes for a more complete discussion of this topic.


Hypocholesterolemia: As noted above, decreased liver function should be ruled out as a
cause of the hypocholesterolemia in this patient. Another differential diagnosis in this patient
is hypoadrenocorticism. Keep in mind that not all Addisonians have the classical electrolyte
abnormalities. In particular, patients with glucocorticoid dependent hypoadrenocorticism
often have hypocholesterolemia (Lifton). The absence of adequate amounts of cortisol in the
circulation may alter cholesterol absorption from the gut, or may depress hepatic production
by failing to appropriately suppress the metabolic rate, particularly during illness.


Coagulation data: Prolongation of both the PT and the APTT demonstrate deficiencies of
secondary coagulation involving both the extrinsic and intrinsic or the common pathways.
This abnormality in combination with the moderate thrombocytopenia and the presence of
fibrin degradation products is diagnostic for DIC. Decreased liver function may contribute to
the prolongation of the PT and APTT secondary to diminished production of coagulation
factors and poor liver function can be associated with increased FDPs because of impaired
clearance by the liver. Conversely, DIC can be associated with liver disease secondary to a
number of mechanisms including impaired clearance of activated clotting factors, altered
production of pro- and anticoagulants, and endothelial cell activation within a markedly


vascular sinusoidal organ. Sepsis and cardiovascular collapse with poor tissue perfusion may
also result in DIC.


Abdominal fluid analysis: Kazoo’s abdominal fluid is an exudate characterized by
suppurative inflammation. The recent abdominal surgery may explain some or all of the
inflammation. While there is no direct evidence of a bacterial cause (no organisms are seen
and the neutrophils are nondegenerate), sepsis should be suspected due to the patient’s
poor clinical condition and DIC. A culture of the fluid is strongly recommended.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

At the time of presentation, Kazoo’s clinical signs were suggestive for sepsis, and thoracic
radiographs were supportive of pneumonia. Kazoo slowly improved on intravenous
antibiotics and fluids, however his progress was slower than expected. Because of the
combination of poor clinical response with persistent eosinophilia, hypocholesterolemia, and
apparent difficulties maintaining adequate blood glucose concentrations, Kazoo was
evaluated for hypoadrenocorticism. An ACTH stimulation test revealed a resting cortisol
value of 0.21 µg/dl (reference interval 2-6) and a post ACTH cortisol level of <0.20 µg/dl
(reference interval 6-18), supporting a diagnosis of hypoadrenocorticism. Kazoo was
discharged on oral antibiotics and oral prednisone with the recommendation that his owners
try to fatten him up. All serum biochemical abnormalities had resolved on re-evaluation of
the patient several weeks after therapy, so work up for potential liver failure was not pursued.


Primary hypoadrenocorticism results from loss of approximately 85-90% of both adrenal
cortices. Secondary hypoadrenocorticism due to lesions in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis
resulting in ACTH deficiency is rare. Immune mediated destruction of the adrenal glands is
the suspected cause of hypoadrenocorticism in many patients, although granulomatous
disease, infarction, trauma, metastatic disease, and iatrogenic causes are also possible.
Patients with hypoadrenocorticism often have nonspecific signs such as weakness and give
the impression of severe illness. Vague gastrointestinal signs may be present. Although most
patients with hypoadrenocorticism have insufficiency of all zones of the adrenal cortex,
classical laboratory abnormalities on the serum biochemical profile including hyponatremia,
hypochloremia, and hyperkalemia reflect the mineralocorticoid deficiency. Because these
abnormalities are not consistently present in all patients with hypoadrenocorticism, ACTH
stimulation testing is recommended for the evaluation of patients with suggestive
presentations (Peterson). Kazoo is in the minority of patients in which the destruction of all
cortical zones is not equal, resulting in evidence of glucocorticoid insufficiency, but not
mineralocorticoid deficiency. Although hypoadrenocorticism may have an insidious onset with
a waxing and waning presentation, a stressful event may precipitate clinical signs of hypoadrenocorticism. The stress of the tennis ball foreign body and surgery likely resulted in the
abrupt onset of clinical signs in this patient. It is probable that signs of mineralocorticoid
deficiency will eventually develop, and Kazoo should be monitored with this in mind.


Like Bursley (Case 10) and Salvatore (Case 11), an endocrinopathy led to abnormalities in
glucose and cholesterol homeostasis, reinforcing the important role of hormones in
modulating metabolism. As we saw with Maya (Case 9) and Freeze (Case 8), any patient with
signs of sepsis should be monitored for hypoglycemia. These patients tend to present with
more severe signs of illness than patients presenting with hypoglycemia associated with
neoplasia (see Cases 4, 5, and 6, Kippy, Ides, and Russell). Depression caused by severe
illness may be indistinct from clinical signs of hypoglycemia in septic patients. Kazoo’s
endocrinopathy predisposed him to have hypoglycemia in response to periods of anorexia or
increased glucose utilization that would normally be bridged by hepatic gluconeogenesis. It


is not possible to know whether Kazoo was also septic, since cultures were not performed.
He did not have hyperbilirubinemia, as do some septic patients.

GI Case 13 – Level 1
“Shorty” is an 11-year-old spayed female domestic shorthaired cat presenting with a history
of several weeks of inappetance. During the past week, she has been anorexic, vomiting, and
lethargic. Previous treatment consisting of a diet change and prednisone did not result in
clinical improvement. On physical examination, Shorty has a left parasternal grade III/VI
systolic heart murmur, is dehydrated, and has a firm, palpable cranial abdominal mass. The
remainder of the physical examination is within normal limits. Abdominal radiographs show a
cranial abdominal mass that could involve the liver, pancreas, or spleen. On ultrasound, the
liver is diffusely nodular. The palpable mass is in or near the pancreas.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Shorty has a mild, mature neutrophilic leukocytosis and lymphopenia which is consistent
with the history of having been treated with corticosteroids or may occur with stress.


Serum Biochemical Profile:
Hyperglycemia: The most likely cause for the mild hyperglycemia in this patient is stress,
which is supported by the concurrent stress or corticosteroid leukogram. Diabetes mellitus
cannot be ruled out, but is unlikely based on the mild elevation, normal urinalysis and
absence of classic clinical history.


Marked hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia (10 and 125 x the upper limit of reference
ranges, respectively): Both decreased glomerular filtration rates and the administration of
corticosteroids have been reported to increased serum amylase and lipase levels up to 4x the
upper limit of the reference range. Although Shorty has been treated with corticosteroids,
renal function appears to be good. Shorty is not azotemic despite being dehydrated, and the
urine is very concentrated. The marked elevations here are more compatible with primary
pancreatic pathology, although many cats with pancreatic disease may have normal
pancreatic enzyme levels.


Urinalysis: No significant abnormalities. The urine is appropriately concentrated for a
dehydrated cat.


Coagulation profile: Normal

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Cytologic specimens of the pancreas and biopsies of the liver were obtained at the time of
ultrasound examination. Cytology smears (Figure 3-5) were interpreted to be compatible with
epithelial neoplasia, and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma was identified on liver biopsy
specimens. Despite the presence of tumor in the liver, liver enzyme data was unremarkable,
as we have seen in Kippy (primary hepatocellular carcinoma-Case 4) and Russell (metastatic


insulinoma-Case 6). A trypsin-like immunoreactivity test (TLI) was performed to support a
diagnosis of primary pancreatic disease, and TLI was found to be elevated (305 µg/L,
reference interval 12-82). Shorty was discharged with a grave prognosis and died at home
several weeks later.


Figure 3-5. Smears collected from
the pancreas consisted of
amorphous debris and multiple
sheets of epithelial cells The cells
are characterized by scant slightly
grainy basophilic cytoplasm. Each
cell contains a single nucleus with
coarse chromatin and a single
large nucleolus. Anisocytosis and
anisokaryosis are mild.


The laboratory work in this case is compatible with either pancreatitis or pancreatic
neoplasia. Increased serum lipase can occur in dogs with pancreatic or hepatic neoplasia
(Quigley). Unfortunately, serum amylase and lipase are less useful in cats than in dogs or
people for the diagnosis of pancreatic disease, and other hematologic and biochemical
abnormalities are nonspecific (Gerhardt). Some authors have suggested that serum amylase
and lipase are actually of no diagnostic utility for pancreatitis in cats (Simpson, Williams). TLI
has been proposed as a better alternative for the diagnosis of pancreatic disease in the cat,
and was elevated in this patient. TLI is not increased in all feline patients with pancreatic
pathology, however, and TLI may be elevated in cats with inflammatory bowel disease or
gastrointestinal lymphoma (Swift). In this case, the presence of a mass and cytology
suggested neoplasia rather than inflammation. Ultrasonography has been advocated as a test
for pancreatitis in cats, but some reports suggest that imaging studies are less helpful than
originally thought (Saunders).
