###### **Interpretation**

CBC: The mild lymphopenia is likely secondary to stress/corticosteroid response.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Mild increases in ALP and GGT: Increases in these enzymes suggest some degree of
cholestasis. Since the bilirubin is within the reference interval, cholestasis may be mild. Many
potential causes of increased ALP exist (see Chapter 2), and enzyme induction by some
mechanisms may not increase bilirubin.


Mildly increased ALT and AST: Hepatocellular damage results in increased release of these
enzymes from liver cells.


Mild increase in amylase, marked increase in lipase: Minor elevations in amylase and lipase
may be present in patients with decreased glomerular filtration rates. Since this patient is not
azotemic, this appears unlikely in this case. Intestinal disease may increase concentrations of
these enzymes in the blood, and the Muffy’s clinical signs support some type of intestinal
disease. Pancreatitis is a major differential diagnosis in patients with marked elevations of
serum amylase and lipase. Muffy’s case is somewhat unusual in that the increase in amylase is
mild, while the lipase levels are dramatically increased. This pattern has been reported in
association with pancreatic and hepatic neoplasia (Quigley).

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

On survey radiographs, Muffy had a diffuse nodular pattern in her lungs and a calcified mass
in her abdomen. On ultrasound, the liver and spleen appeared normal. Multiple mineralized
nodules could be visualized in the pancreas. Cytologic specimens of the pancreatic masses
and some mesenteric nodules consisted of multiple clusters of tightly adherent atypical
epithelial cells consistent with carcinoma, as well as crystalline material compatible with the
mineralization. Surgical biopsy results were diagnostic for a poorly differentiated carcinoma,
possible of endocrine or neuroendocrine origin. Muffy was treated with antibiotics, antacids,
and metoclopramide, and began chemotherapy.


Pancreatitis is an important differential diagnosis in this case. Most dogs with pancreatitis will
have some evidence of inflammation on the CBC, however a normal CBC does not
completely rule out pancreatitis. Mild liver enzyme elevations are commonly associated with
pancreatitis because of local inflammation or partial to complete obstruction of bile flow.
While there is potential for hepatic metastases in Muffy, elevations of liver enzymes are not
uniformly noted in patients with metastatic neoplasia in the liver (Shorty-Case 13, metastatic
pancreatic carcinoma and Russell-Case 6, metastatic insulinoma). Trypsin-like immunoreactivity testing can be performed to help substantiate a diagnosis of pancreatitis, but was not
needed in this case because of the differential elevation of lipase and amylase and the
agreement of the cytology and biopsy results on the diagnosis of malignancy.

GI Case 15 – Level 2
“Quasi” is a one-year-old neutered male German Shepherd cross presenting for vomiting,
lethargy, and inappetance. A foreign body obstruction was suspected, but radiographs of the
abdomen were inconclusive. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a 15 x 4 cm mass in the area of
the pancreas with a moderate amount of abdominal effusion. Quasi is being treated with
phenobarbital for idiopathic epilepsy, which is well controlled. Phenobarbital levels are in the
therapeutic range.

Direct smears are of high cellularity. Cells are in good condition and consist of 84%
nondegenerate neutrophils, 13% macrophages, and 3% mature lymphocytes. The
macrophages contain abundant pale cytoplasm with clear vacuoles and occasional cellular
debris. The background contains moderate numbers of erythrocytes and granular precipitate
due to the high protein content of the fluid. No microorganisms or atypical cells are seen.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Quasi has a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis and monocytosis characteristic of an
inflammatory leukogram. The increased hemoglobin concentration and MCHC is an artifact
related to the hemolysis and/or lipemia, since erythrocytes do not overproduce hemoglobin
and the hematocrit is within the reference interval.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Mild hypoalbuminemia: Both decreased production by the liver or increased losses can
contribute to low albumin. Albumin is a negative acute phase reactant, which can limit
hepatic production of this protein with inflammation. Marked liver failure is possible in this
patient, however specific tests of liver function such as bile acids are required to further
evaluate this possibility. Decreased production may be secondary to poor nutritional plane,
which is not the case in this patient. Increased losses of albumin must also be considered,
and the most likely site of protein loss for Quasi is into the abdominal effusion. The potential
for renal loss of protein could be evaluated by performing a urinalysis and/or a urine
protein:creatinine ratio. Gastrointestinal losses are more difficult to quantitate.


Mild hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Increased electrolyte losses or dilution secondary to
retention of free water are common causes of electrolyte abnormalites. Sources of loss are
similar to those for protein, and third space loss into the effusion is most likely in this patient.
Gastrointestinal or renal losses are also possible. When inappropriate renal losses of
electrolytes are suspected, urinary fractional excretions can be performed. Hyponatremia and
hypochloremia due to decreased intake is uncommon in domestic animals.


Mildly elevated ALT and AST: Increases in these enzymes indicate some degree of
hepatocellular damage. Because of the close anatomic proximity of the pancreas and liver and
the vascular anatomy, hepatocellular damage in patients with pancreatitis is likely related to
hepatic ischemia or toxins and inflammatory mediators originating in the inflamed pancreas.
The potential for concurrent cholestasis is difficult to evaluate because hemolysis has
invalidated relevent measurements. Primary hepatic pathology cannot be excluded at this time.
The history of treatment with phenobarbital is important in this case because of the ability of
this drug to cause microsomal enzyme induction, resulting in reversible increases in ALP (2-12
times normal) and ALT (2 to 5 times normal). Alternatively, phenobarbital may cause true
hepatic injury in some animals. Signs of this include a greater increase in ALT than ALP or


evidence of liver dysfunction such as increased serum bile acid concentrations, hypoalbuminemia, and/or hypocholesterolemia.


Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia: Fasting hyperlipidemia is commonly
associated with pancreatitis. As seen here, the increase in triglycerides is often of a greater
magnitude than the hypercholesterolemia. The elevated triglycerides impart a milky
appearance to the serum, and predispose to _in vitro_ hemolysis, so the plasma may have a
“tomato soup” appearance. In some cases, hyperlipidemia may predispose the patient to
pancreatitis, while in other cases it may occur secondary to decreased lipoprotein lipase
activity with pancreatitis. Alternatively, some authors cite lipolysis of intra-abdominal fat by
free pancreatic enzymes as a contributor. Hyperlipidemia also may be the result of eating a
fatty meal, liver disease, idiopathic conditions, or endocrinopathies such as hyperadrenocorticism, hypothyroidism, or diabetes mellitus.


Elevated amylase and lipase: The combination of increased amylase and lipase should lead
the clinician to consider pancreatitis as a differential diagnosis. Unfortunately, extrapancreatic
sources of these enzymes exist, and greater than two-fold elevations can occur in patients
with gastritis, diseases of the small intestine, and liver pathology. Decreased glomerular
filtration rate can also increase serum concentrations of these enzymes up to 2-3 times the
upper limit of the reference interval. Lipase is considered to be more specific for pancreatitis
than amylase, although treatment with dexamethasone can increase lipase without parallel
increases in amylase. Serum amylase and lipase activity within the reference interval does not
rule out pancreatic inflammation. Pancreatic neoplasia may be associated with increases in
serum amylase and lipase.


Abdominal fluid analysis: The fluid is an exudate with evidence of suppurative inflammation.
The absence of degenerate changes in the neutrophils and bacteria supports sterile
inflammation, a common finding in canine patients with pancreatitis.


Coagulation Profile: The coagulation profile in this patient is within normal limits. Systemic
inflammation characteristic of severe acute pancreatitis can lead to endothelial cell damage
from neutrophil proteases and oxidants. In some patients, the resulting endothelial cell
activation and exposure of basement membrane collagen can trigger coagulation and lead to
disseminated intravascular coagulation.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

During exploratory surgery an enlarged, inflamed pancreas and edematous peripancreatic fat
were seen. The abdomen was flushed, and a jejunostomy tube was placed. Biopsy specimens
demonstrated severe steatitis, however no actual pancreatic tissue was present in the
sections. Hepatic changes included moderate capsulitis, but no parenchymal abnormalities.
Quasi vomited intermittently for the first few days after surgery, but ultimately began eating
solid food and was discharged.


Quasi has typical abnormalities in routine clinical pathology data suggestive for pancreatitis,
including an inflammatory leukogram and fasting hyperlipidemia. When pancreatitis results in
a significant abdominal effusion, protein and electrolytes may decreased because of third
space loss. Note that the presence or absence of an identifiable mass lesion did NOT
differentiate inflammation from neoplasia. In contrast to Muffy (Case 14-pancreatic
carcinoma) who had marked increases in lipase with almost negligible changes in amylase,
Quasi has elevations in both pancreatic enzymes.


There is no ideal widely available test for pancreatitis. For diagnosis, clinicians often rely on


the presence of a combination of clinical signs and laboratory abnormalities compatible with
the disorder. As was noted for this patient, an inflammatory leukogram, elevated liver
enzymes, and hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia) are common
findings. Depending on the duration and severity of disease, concurrent electrolyte, acid
base and coagulation abnormalities along with pre-renal azotemia may be present. Some
patients are hypocalcemic. In addition to the measurement of amylase and lipase, serum
trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) may be measured and tends to increase sooner and more
proportional to severity than other enzymes. Since serum TLI is pancreas specific, it may have
some advantages over amylase and lipase, however decreased glomerular filtration rate will
increase TLI similar to amylase and lipase. Severe malnutrition and very high protein diets can
also elevate TLI. TLI is an immunoassay, and differences in the enzyme structures make it
necessary to have species-specific assays. New assays for the measurement of pancreatic
lipase in dogs and cats are now being developed and validated. Initial data look promising,
however further research is needed.
