Hypochloremia: In this case, the most likely cause of the mild hypochloremia with normal
serum sodium levels is loss by vomiting.


Hyperbilirubinemia: As always, hemolysis and liver disease are the main differential
diagnoses for hyperbilirubinemia. This patient is anemic, however she also has elevated liver
enzymes. Septic patients may have hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of either of these
conditions because endotoxin can directly impair hepatocellular uptake of bilirubin.


Increased ALP (2x): Elevated ALP in this patient is likely due to cholestasis, however enzyme
induction and extrahepatic causes of increased ALP must also be considered.


Increased ALT (1.5x) and AST (5x): These changes are indicative of hepatocellular damage.


Elevated amylase: The increased amylase may be attributable to decreased GFR, however
pancreatitis cannot be ruled out, especially considering the clinical signs in this patient.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Cholestasis and hepatocellular damage, pre-renal azotemia, septic peritonitis. The possibility
of pancreatitis needs to be further evaluated.


Abdominal radiographs revealed an enlarged liver with a large gas filled area compatible with
a liver abscess (Figure 2-4). Bruja underwent exploratory surgery, but died during the
procedure. Histologic sections of the liver revealed a chronic active pericholangiohepatitis with
mild to moderate bridging fibrosis and micronodular hyperplasia. The abscessed tissue was
not included in the submitted tissue. Micronodular hyperplasia is a common lesion in aged
dogs. The cause for the other lesions is less clear, as is the possible relationship between the
liver abscess and the chronic drainage from the spay incision.


In contrast to Lady and Patton (Cases 7 and 8), it cannot be determined if cholestasis or
hepatocellular damage predominates using the laboratory data for this patient. This case is a
good illustration of the failure of the degree of liver enzyme elevations to provide an accurate
prognosis (Tip 4 in the introduction to the chapter). Despite the presence of significant liver
pathology, enzyme abnormalities were relatively modest (Tip 6).


Hepatic abscesses are uncommon in the dog. In puppies, they may occur secondary to
omphalophlebitis, while in adult dogs they are considered a complication of hematogenous
spread from another septic process (Grooters). Clinical signs are nonspecific. Common
laboratory findings in patients with hepatic abscesses include inflammatory leukograms and


mild anemia, particularly if the process is chronic. There is often mild to marked thrombocytopenia, but since Bruja’s platelets were clumped, we cannot determine if this abnormality was
present in her case. Serum biochemical abnormalities include hyperbilirubinemia and elevated
hepatocellular and cholestatic enzymes, as we see in this case. It should be noted that not all
dogs with liver abscesses have elevated ALT or AST (Farrar), so normal hepatocellular enzymes
do not exclude this condition. Nonspecific biochemical abnormalities associated with vomiting
and diarrhea may also be present. Imaging studies are often helpful to distinguish hepatic
abscesses from other causes of liver enzyme elevations, however it may be difficult to
differentiate some lesions such as hepatic cysts, hematomas, and tumors from hepatic
abscesses. Cytologic evaluation of aspirates from these masses can help differentiate these
etiologies, however the potential to spread infection must be considered.

Liver Case 10 – Level 2
“Dervish” is a 6-month-old Norwegian Forest cat with a history of pectus excavatum and
intermittent episodes of coughing and wheezing. Four days after castration surgery, he
became listless and febrile. After receiving supportive care (including fluid therapy) from the
referring veterinarian, the cat was sent to the teaching hospital for further evaluation. On
presentation, Dervish was wheezing and dypneic, had mydriasis, and exhibited decreased
mentation.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: The leukopenia is characterized by neutropenia and lymphopenia. Differentials
for the neutropenia include consumptive processes such as acute severe inflammation in
which tissue demand for neutrophils exceeds marrow production, immune-mediated
destruction (rare), and/or decreased production. The concurrent presence of a nonregenerative anemia could indicate some bone marrow disease, however the degree of anemia is
more compatible with anemia of chronic disease. Lymphopenia may be due to stress
(corticoteroid effects), although viral infection is another possibility that might also explain
damage to other hematopoietic precursors.


Erythrogram: Mild normocytic anemia. The most likely cause for this, as indicated above,
would be anemia of chronic disease. The elevated MCHC should be interpreted as artifact.
Increases in MCHC may be due to intravascular hemolysis, ex vivo rupture of red blood cells
due to sample handling, lipemia, or Heinz bodies.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: There is a mild hyperglycemia present. This is most likely due to stress or
glucose-containing fluid administration.


Decreased BUN: Decreased production secondary to hepatic insufficiency or dietary protein
restriction may lower BUN. Because liver enzyme activities are elevated and coagulation
times are prolonged, a decreased BUN in this case suggests hepatic insufficiency and the
need for liver function tests. Given the low specific gravity of the urine, increased excretion
as a result of diuresis could also contribute to the low BUN in this patient. This patient has
been treated with fluids, calling into question the significance of the urine specific gravity as
an indicator of renal concentrating ability. Serum creatinine is normal, suggesting that renal
function is adequate.


Hypoproteinemia: Although the total protein is low, both albumin and globulins are within
reference ranges. The albumin is at the lower end of the reference range and should be
monitored. If liver function tests support decreased liver function, albumin may continue to
drop, however liver dysfunction must be severe for this to occur.


Hyperbilirubinemia: The degree of hyperbilirubinemia is mild, and is compatible with
decreased liver function and/or some degree of cholestasis. The latter conclusion is
supported by the increased ALP. The leukopenia and fever suggest that sepsis must be ruled
out as a cause for decreased bilirubin uptake by hepatocytes. Hemolytic disease is less likely


to be a major contributor because of the mildly decreased PCV and the lack of erythrocyte
morphological changes indicating a mechanism for hemolysis. In addition, most significant
hemolytic disease results in a regenerative response. Hemolytic anemia may initially appear
nonregenerative if the CBC is performed within the first few days of onset. It takes at least 3
days after the onset of anemia before a significant reticulocytosis can be detected.


Increased ALP: There is a 4-fold elevation in ALP, compatible with cholestasis. Increases in
ALP are more specific for cholestasis in cats than dogs, because nonspecific enzyme
induction is less common. As a result, smaller increases in ALP are considered significant in
cats compared to dogs. In this case, cholestasis is probably secondary to a more significant
hepatocellular insult (see below).


Increased ALT and AST: The 20-fold increase in ALT and AST support hepatocellular injury as
the primary problem in Dervish. While there may be some degree of hypoxia because of the
anemia and respiratory disease, other causes of hepatocellular damage should be
investigated.


Urinalysis: Dervish is isosthenuric, however it is difficult to assess his renal function for several
reasons. He has had fluid therapy as part of his supportive regime, which will decrease his
urine specific gravity. In addition, other data suggest that decreased liver function may
suppress his BUN. Polyuria/polydypsia is frequent in dogs with liver disease, but is seen less
often in cats. When present, polyuria/polydipsia may be associated with hepatic
encephalopathy, which likely explains the impaired mentation observed in Dervish. In dogs
with hepatic encephalopathy, abnormal neurotransmitters increase stimulation of the pituitary,
leading to hypercortisolism and an increased osmotic threshold for antidiuretic hormone
release. The 2+ bilirubin and bilirubin crystals are secondary to the hyperbilirubinemia.


Coagulation: Both the PT and APTT are markedly prolonged, consistent with defective
secondary hemostasis. In combination with the clinical signs and low BUN, prolonged clotting
times suggest the possibility of decreased liver function and appropriate testing should be
done. Dervish also may have significant inflammatory disease and/or sepsis, as supported by
the fever and leukopenia, so he may be predisposed to the development of disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC). Platelets appear adequate, making DIC less likely at this time.
Measurement of fibrin degradation products would help sort this out.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Marked hepatocellular damage with mild secondary cholestasis, defective secondary
hemostasis. Severe neutropenia with nonregenerative anemia suggestive for inflammation.


Dervish has decreased liver function based on a plasma ammonia level of 48.0 µM/L
(Reference Interval 0-24). Bile acids are another test of liver function. In general, bile acids are
often the test of choice to evaluate liver function because they are more sensitive than blood
ammonia levels and require less finicky handling. Samples for bile acid measurement do not
have to be kept on ice, or run within 30 minutes, as do samples for blood ammonia.
However, bile acids are of less use in patients with increased bilirubin due to cholestasis and
may be more useful in those with equivocal liver enzyme levels, normal bilirubin or suspected
hemolysis. Additionally, post-prandial bile acid levels are preferred over fasted for the
detection of decreased liver function in cats. Unfortunately, Dervish’s diminished neurologic
function interfered with eating. Ammonia is the only toxin implicated in hepatic
encephalopathy that can be measured clinically, and was a good choice in this case.


While Cases 7 and 8 (Lady and Patton) certainly had significant liver disease, there was little
evidence on the serum biochemical profile of decreased liver function. Indicators of
decreased liver function on routine blood work are subtle and nonspecific. Due to the
remarkable reserve of liver function in animals, these abnormalities occur very late in disease
or with fulminant acute processes, once the majority of organ function is lost. Clues to
decreased liver function on routine laboratory work include decreased BUN, decreased
creatinine (less often), decreased urinary concentrating ability, hypoalbuminemia,
hypoglycemia, hypocholesterolemia, and prolonged clotting times. Evidence for decreased
liver function may occur simultaneously with evidence of hepatocellular damage such as
enzyme elevations, however liver enzyme levels are NOT always abnormal in patients with
decreased liver function. Despite the loss of the majority of functional hepatic mass, liver
enzyme values are rarely below reference range in these patients. If liver enzyme levels are
markedly high at presentation and begin to drop over time, the patient may be improving, or
alternatively, may be losing functional hepatic mass.


Dervish was treated for hepatic encephalopathy and improved following administration of
intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and vitamin K for his coagulopathy. He was discharged from
the hospital without liver biopsy, so the cause for his liver disease was not identified.
Abdominal ultrasound was normal, and serologic testing for FeLV, FIV, and toxoplasmosis was
negative. Liver enzyme values eventually normalized, but Dervish has remained blind. The
consulting opthalmologist diagnosed central retinal degeneration, a possible inherited
condition. Dervish was given valium at the time of neutering, which has been reported to
cause fulminant hepatic failure in some cats (Center). However the cats in that published
report received repeated oral dosing. Other underlying factors such portovascular anomalies
were also considered.


Dervish has had waxing and waning neutropenia for over 2 years, with evidence of myeloid
hyperplasia on repeated bone marrow samples. Episodes of neutropenia are associated with
fever and opportunistic bacterial infections which respond to antibiotics. The cause for
neutropenia has not been determined.

Liver Case 11 – Level 2
“Squid” is an 11-year-old, spayed female domestic shorthaired cat with a history of lethargy,
anorexia, and weight loss. She presented dehydrated and weak with icteric mucus
membranes. Her liver is enlarged and can be palpated approximately 4 cm past the last costal
cartilage. The margins of the liver are rounded. On survey radiographs of the abdomen, both
kidneys appear to be normal sized, but 4 radio-opaque cystic calculi are seen.
