###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Deputy has a mild normocytic normochromic, likely nonregenerative anemia that could
be compatible with chronic disease. The anemia may be worse once fluid deficits are
corrected. If renal azotemia is documented, renal failure should be considered as a contributor
to nonregenerative anemia. In combination with the thrombocytopenia, a primary marrow
disorder is possible, and marrow evaluation should be considered if peripheral factors cannot
account for the cytopenias. A thorough drug history should be taken to ensure that no myelosuppressive medication has been administered. Alternative causes for the anemia include
acute blood loss with insufficient time for marrow response. This is possible if there is
hemorrhage associated with the thrombocytopenia. Hemolysis is a consideration because of
the presence of icterus, however there are no morphologic abnormalities of the erythrocytes
described that might suggest a stimulus for hemolysis (spherocytes, agglutination, Heinz
bodies, etc.). Hemolytic anemias also are typically regenerative unless the patient presents in
very acute stages or there are other factors suppressing marrow response.


Given the severe skin lesions, the lack of an inflammatory leukogram is surprising. An
inflammatory response may be masked by increased tissue migration of neutrophils. The
lymphopenia is likely associated with endogenous corticosteroid effects or may potentially be
related to therapeutic corticosteroid use for the skin disease. Protein losing enteropathy may
also be associated with a lymphopenia.


The thrombocytopenia may be related consumption of platelets secondary to immunemediated clearance, hemorrhage, endothelial damage, or as part of disseminated
intravascular coagulation. DIC would be be compatible with the results of the coagulation
profile. Viral infections and neoplasia should also be ruled out. As noted above, a primary
marrow disorder may account for thrombocytopenia if production of platelets is suppressed.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia: The azotemia cannot be definitively classified without a urine specific gravity.
Deputy is dehydrated on presentation, so at least a component of the azotemia is
attributable to pre-renal factors.


Hypercalcemia with hyperphosphatemia: Older small animal patients with hypercalcemia
should be evaluated for the presence of neoplasia. In this case, ultrasound with cytology or
biopsy of the liver should be a top priority because of the icterus and enzyme elevations.
Hypercalcemia of malignancy usually causes a compensatory decrease in phosphorus,
however this may be complicated by decreased renal phosphorus excretion secondary to the
decreased glomerular filtration rate suspected in this dog. Renal failure could also result in
this combination of abnormalities. Ionized calcium is more likely to be elevated in patients
with hypercalcemia of malignancy than renal failure. Parathyroid hormone related protein
(PTHrP) is often elevated in hypercalcemia of malignancy, but would expected to be normal
in patients with renal failure. Primary hyperparathyroidism can cause increases in total and
ionized calcium, but generally causes hypophosphatemia unless renal issues complicate the
presentation (See Case 6, Picasso). Less likely differential diagnoses include Vitamin D
toxicosis and hypoadrenocorticism. Hypoadrenocorticism is less likely given the normal
electrolytes and lymphopenia, but an atypical presentation is possible. If there is evidence of
lameness or bone pain, the patient should be examined for osteolytic lesions.


Hypoalbuminemia: Because Deputy is dehydrated, both albumin and globulin levels may
decrease after fluid therapy. Both decreased production and increased losses should be
evaluated as contributors to low serum albumin. Decreased liver function can lead to


inadequate production of albumin. With liver disease, other laboratory abnormalities would
be expected such as hypoglycemia (inadequate hepatic gluconeogenesis), low BUN, hypocholesterolemia, hyperbilirubinemia, prolongation clotting times (inadequate production of
clotting factors or vitamin K absorption), mildly increased FDPs (decreased hepatic
clearance), and the production of poorly concentrated urine (multiple mechanisms, see
Chapter 2, Case 10). While Deputy has some of these abnormalities, none are specific for
liver failure. Serum bile acids or blood ammonia measurements should be considered if liver
function requires further evaluation. Albumin production may also decrease in patients with
significant inflammatory disease because albumin is a negative acute phase reactant.
Nutritional factors may impair albumin synthesis, but this is rare and generally associated with
severe or prolonged starvation and poor body condition (See Chapter 5, Case 3).


Hypoalbuminemia may also occur with increased losses of albumin. In this case, loss of
protein via exudative skin lesions is likely. Additional protein could be lost into the abdominal
effusion or with hemorrhage, although bleeding is not described in the clinical history.
Protein also may be lost via the gastrointestinal tract or kidneys. Most types of protein loss
result in wasting of both albumin and globulins, but glomerular protein losses are relatively
selective for albumin. Because the hypoalbuminemia is associated with normal globulins in
this patient, glomerular disease is possible, but cannot be evaluated adequately because
urinalysis data is not available. Because Deputy likely has significant inflammatory disease, he
is likely to be hyperglobulinemic but nonspecific protein losses may have reduced the
globulin levels back to within reference intervals.


Hyperbilirubinemia: Hemolysis is a possible cause for increased serum bilirubin and is
discussed in the CBC section. Liver disease is another important consideration. The potential
for cholestasis is supported by elevations in ALP and GGT, though they may also be elevated
due to enzyme induction if Deputy has been treated with corticosteroids for his skin lesions.
Decreased liver function could impair hepatocellular uptake of bile (see section on hypoalbuminemia), and sepsis may interfere with bile uptake (See Chapter 2, Case 8). Expected
leukogram abnormalities associated with sepsis are not present, however Deputy presents in
poor condition with extensive compromise of the skin barrier that could predispose him to
bacteremia. The abnormalities of the coagulation profile are compatible with either liver
failure or DIC secondary to sepsis.


Increased ALP and GGT: Elevations in ALP and GGT are supportive of cholestasis. There are
numerous extrahepatic causes of liver enzyme elevations that should also be considered,
however the concurrent hyperbilirubinemia makes liver disease more likely. Liver enzyme
elevations alone are not helpful in identifying a specific cause for liver disease. Liver damage
may occur secondary to numerous systemic processes, including sepsis and disseminated
intravascular coagulation. Cholestasis also may occur secondary to cell swelling associated
with hepatocellular damage.


Increased ALT and AST: These enzyme elevations indicate hepatocellular damage. ALT is
more liver specific than AST, which originates from many tissues. As stated above, primary
liver disease must be distinguished from numerous other potential causes of hepatocellular
insult. The toxic effects of bile retention associated with cholestasis can cause hepatocellular
damage. In this case, cholestatic and hepatocellular enzyme elevations are of similar
magnitude, so a predominant process cannot be presumed.


Hypocholesterolemia: This abnormalitiy is of limited clinical significance, but can occur with
poor liver function (See Chapter 3, Case 7), hypoadrenocorticism (See Chapter 3, Case 12),
or protein-losing enteropathy (also compatible with lymphopenia).


Coagulation profile: The combination of thrombocytopenia, prolonged coagulation times,
and >20 µg/dl FDPs is compatible with DIC. Increased FDPs are often used to support a
diagnosis of DIC, although they are neither sensitive nor specific and may increase with liver
failure due to decreased clearance or be associated with hemorrhage. In liver failure, both
prothrombin time (PT) and normal activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) are usually
prolonged, however this can be inconsistent early in the course of disease. The prolonged PT
and normal APTT may be seen early in cases of Vitamin K antagonist poisoning because of
the short half-life of Factor VII, which is in the extrinsic pathway. Ultimately, both the PT and
APTT usually become prolonged with Vitamin K antagonism.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Two liters of fluid were removed from Deputy’s abdomen, and he was treated with plasma,
crystalloids, and antibiotics. Abdominal ultrasound revealed abnormal nodules throughout the
liver and spleen. Multiple lymph nodes throughout the abdomen were enlarged, and the
stomach wall was thickened. Cytology samples from the liver were diagnostic for lymphoma,
and impression smears from the skin indicated pyogranulomatous inflammation of unknown
cause. Deputy was euthanized due to deteriorating condition and poor prognosis. On necropsy,
the liver, lymph nodes, and adrenal glands contained evidence of lymphoma, however the
spleen was histologically normal. Unfortunately, bone marrow was not evaluated to assist with
interpretation of the CBC abnormalities. The cause of the dermatitis was not determined.


The cause for the hypercalcemia was interpreted to be lymphoma, although measurement of
PTHrP was not performed. Deputy’s case may be compared with Chapter 2, Case 21
(Snoopy), who also had hepatic lymphoma but was not hypercalcemic. Most animals
presenting with malignant neoplasia have normal serum calcium, however when the serum
calcium is elevated, neoplasia should be considered. Deputy can also be compared with
Cleopatra (Case 7), who had hypercalcemia accompanied by hyperglobulinemia and bone
pain which led to diagnostic evaluation for multiple myeloma. The development of a
diagnostic plan for evaluation of patients suspected to have hypercalcemia of malignancy is
frequently guided by clinical signs or other laboratory data suggesting involvement of
particular organs (bone in Cleopatra’s case and the liver in Deputy’s case).


Case 15 – Level 3
“Zinger” is an 11-year-old neutered male domestic short haired cat. Zinger was diagnosed
with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and mild left-sided congestive heart failure one month
ago, for which he is being treated with diuretics (furosemide) and aspirin. Historical
laboratory abnormalities at the time of diagnosis included prerenal azotemia (urine specific
gravity 1.056) and mild elevations of ALT and AST that were interpreted to be compatible
with the cardiac disease. His thyroid panel was within normal limits. Two weeks ago, Zinger
presented with thrombosis of his right front foot, which was managed successfully with
anticoagulants. Today, Zinger presents with a four day history of anorexia, vomiting, and
decreased urinations. He is dehydrated, depressed, and has a very small bladder. Zinger’s
respiratory rate and effort are increased.

###### **Interpretation**

Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: The hyperglycemia is likely stress-induced, although no supportive
leukogram findings are available. The absence of glucose in the urine makes diabetes
mellitus less likely.


Azotemia: Azotemia should be categorized as pre-renal, renal, or post-renal. The minimally
concentrated urine supports the possibility of renal failure, and there is no evidence of postrenal disease (fluid in the abdomen or a large, firm bladder). In this case, Zinger’s medical
history includes therapy with diuretics, which are expected to decrease his urine specific
gravity. Prior to diuretic use, Zinger had good urinary concentrating ability. At this time, it is
not possible to determine the extent of the urinary concentrating ability in this patient,
however he is extremely azotemic and evidence of continuing azotemia once any fluid
deficits are corrected should be considered evidence of decreased renal function. In addition
to dehydration, compromised cardiac function is a cause of pre-renal azotemia because of
inability to maintain adequate perfusion pressure for glomerular filtration. Diuretics can
subvert the body’s attempt to maintain perfusion pressure through volume loading.


Hyperphosphatemia and normal calcium: The most likely cause of hyperphosphatemia in
this patient is decreased glomerular filtration rate, regardless of whether the decreased
glomerular filtration rate is due to pre-renal, renal, or post-renal causes. Tissue necrosis can
also increase serum phosphorus by releasing intracellular phosphorus. Small animal patients
in renal failure may have high, normal, or low serum calcium levels, and ionized calcium levels
may not correlate with total calcium levels. The calcium as well as the albumin are at the low
end of the reference range, and may reflect protein binding of the calcium to albumin. The
presence of proteinuria in dilute urine without evidence of inflammation is suggestive for
glomerular protein loss and urine protein:creatinine ratios can help quantify the losses.


Hypermagnesemia: Like phosphorus, serum magnesium levels will increase as glomerular
filtration rate declines. In general, furosemide causes decreased serum magnesium. Severe
rhabdomyolysis can lead to extracellular release of magnesium.


Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: The most likely cause of the hyponatremia in this case is
the diuretic therapy and resultant water and electrolyte wasting by the kidneys. The
corrected chloride indicates that the proportional decrease in chloride is greater than that of
sodium, suggesting the potential for an acid/base disturbance.
