Urinalysis: Method of sampling is not indicated.
Appearance: Yellow and clear
Specific gravity: 1.017
pH: 6.0
Protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin: negative
Sediment: Occasional erythrocytes, leukocytes, and epithelial cells seen


Abdominal fluid
Total nucleated cell count: 500/µl
Total protein: 4.0 gm/dl
Description: The fluid contains small numbers of nucleated cells with a
predominance of macrophages. Occasional nondegenerate neutrophils
and a few small lymphocytes can also be seen. No etiologic agents are
seen.

###### **Intepretation**

CBC: Stowaway has a leukocytosis characterized by a monocytosis, compatible with
inflammation. Monocytosis also may accompany tissue necrosis. Both neutrophil numbers
(Figure 7-7) and fibrinogen are at the upper limit of the normal ranges.

Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: This is likely a pronounced stress response, common in camelids (See
Chapter 2, Case 14 for references).


Azotemia: While the hydration status of this alpaca is not indicated, the urine is not well
concentrated, suggestive for renal azotemia. Given the low serum electrolyte concentrations,
medullary washout could interfere with renal concentrating ability in addition to any
concurrent renal disease.


Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia: Hypoalbuminemia with normal globulins often
implies either selective glomerular loss of albumin or decreased production of albumin
associated with liver failure or malnutrition. Liver failure cannot be ruled out, but is less likely
with normal serum bilirubin, ALP and GGT. Stowaway is thin, so nutritional factors may
impact protein balance. Proteinuria was not detected on the urinalysis, however with
relatively dilute urine, a urinary protein:creatinine ratio would be a more sensitive test for
glomerular protein loss. The history of parasitism indicates the potential for gastrointestinal
losses of protein, however these are often nonselective losses. In some cases, increased
production of globulin proteins associated with an acute phase reaction or immune
stimulation may be masked by simultaneous nonselective protein loss, resulting in serum
globulin value within the reference interval.


Low sodium and chloride: The corrected chloride remains below the reference interval at
94 mEq/L. Dilution or increased losses are the most likely mechanism as malnutrition seldom


results in hyponatremia and hypochloremia. Hyperglycemia may cause some osmotic draw of
fluid into the intravascular space, however this should dilute sodium and chloride
approximately equally. Loss of electrolytes by both renal and gastrointestinal routes are
possible in this case. Renal losses could be quantified by calculation of urinary electrolyte
fractional excretions. Patients with renal disease may be less able to conserve sodium when
there is decreased intake and/or increased losses by other routes such as the gastrointestinal
tract. Disproportionate hypochloremia could occur if there is stasis of fluids in the proximal
gastrointestinal tract, which would also be compatible with the increased serum bicarbonate.


Hypokalemia: Decreased intake is more likely to influence the serum potassium level than
sodium and chloride levels. Potassium losses via the kidney and gut may also contribute to
the hypokalemia. Hypokalemia is further potentiated by alkalosis as potassium ions shift intracellularly in exchange for hydrogen ions.


Increased bicarbonate (alkalosis): Sequestration or loss of acid containing gastrointestinal
secretions due to upper gastrointestinal stasis is the likely cause for this abnormality.


Increased LDH, AST, and CK: The combination of enzyme elevations in the absence of a
change in bilirubin, ALP, or GGT suggests muscle damage, which may result from
recumbency or associated with medical procedures.


Urinalysis: This patient appears to have paradoxical aciduria, whereby the conservation of
sodium and chloride is prioritized at the expense of hydrogen loss in the urine.


Abdominal fluid: Because of the relatively low cell count consisting of macrophages and high
protein, this fluid is compatible with a modified transudate. The protein exceeds the 3.5 gm/dl
value typically used for exudate, and repeat sampling may be justified to rule out the
possibility of an early inflammatory reaction.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Treatment with intravenous fluids, gastroprotectants, and pain medication resulted in
normalization of the electrolyte and acid/base abnormalities, however Stowaway was persistently
azotemic. Radiographs showed distended and gas filled small intestines with a severely dilated
intestinal segment in the caudal abdomen. Increased opacity in the second and third gastric
compartments was also noted. The radiologist concluded there was a mechanical or functional
obstruction, which would be compatible with the clinical chemistry data. Because she continued
to be anorexic and recumbent, Stowaway was euthanized. At necropsy, Stowaway had an
annular, sharply demarcated and narrow focus of necrosis in the spiral colon that was compatible
with ischemic necrosis secondary to thrombosis or focal strangulation. The potential for embolic
disease was supported by the presence of multifocal acute thromboemboli in the lungs. Renal
tubular proteinosis with hyaline casts was noted in the kidney. Protein losing nephropathy can be
associated with depletion of endogenous anticoagulants such as antithrombin III, contributing to
development of thromboembolic disease.


While Stowaway’s hyperglycemia and electrolyte abnormalities would be compatible with
diabetes mellitus in other species, the degree of hyperglycemia that can be associated with
stress or illness is exaggerated in camelids. The marked degree of hyperglycemia makes osmotic
dilution of electrolytes possible (See Zippy, Chapter 7, Case 18). However in Stowaway’s case,
gastrointestinal sequestration is an important mechanism underlying the electrolytes changes
and best explains the disproportionate hypochloridemia. Finally, diabetes mellitus is most often
associated with acidosis (Chapter 7, Cases 16, 17, 18), while the metabolic alkalosis present in
this case is more compatible with loss or sequestration of fluid in the upper gastrointestinal tract.


Case 20 – Level 3
“Simba” is a 9-year-old neutered male domestic shorthaired cat presenting with a one day
history of hiding. Prior to this, Simba has been a healthy cat, though lately, he has been
gaining weight from eating special food left out for another cat in the household. He is not
on any medications, and he is current on vaccinations. On presentation, Simba is obtunded
and hypothermic. He is estimated to be 8-10% dehydrated with poor femoral pulses, and his
urinary bladder is distended. Blood was drawn for an initial chemistry panel (Day 1). Because
abdominal radiographs revealed possible uroliths in the bladder, Simba was taken to surgery
for stone removal and to restore patency to the urinary tract. A second chemistry panel was
performed the day after surgery (Day 2).

Urinalysis: sampled from a urinary catheter on Day 2
Specific gravity: 1.011


CBCs were not performed.


Day 1 Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia: Azotemia should be categorized as pre-renal, renal, or post-renal. The clinical
findings of distended urinary bladder and urolithes on radiographs suggest that post-renal
azotemia is likely. Urinary obstruction would also explain the hyperkalemia present on Day 1.
The concurrent dehydration makes it likely that pre-renal factors are exacerbating the azotemia.


Hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia: The most likely cause of hyperphosphatemia in this
patient is decreased glomerular filtration rate, regardless of whether this is due to pre-renal,
renal, or post-renal causes. Other potential causes of hyperphosphatemia include severe
tissue damage. Small animal patients in renal failure may have high, normal, or low serum
calcium levels, and ionized calcium levels may not correlate with total calcium levels as they
often do in healthy animals. In a small study of cats with urethral obstruction, 75% had low


ionized calcium, and 27% had low total calcium (Drobatz). More information on the mechanisms
for these changes is available in Chapter 5, Case 7 (Ringo). The low albumin may make a small
contribution to the decrease in total calcium due to a decrement in protein bound calcium.


Hypermagnesemia: The increase in magnesium is due to decreased renal function.


Hypoproteinemia: The hypoproteinemia is due to a selective decrease in albumin, which may
occur with glomerular damage. A complete urinalysis is needed to determine if there is
proteinuria. Decreased production is unlikely as there is no clear evidence of liver disease, nor is
the cat malnourished.


Hypochloremia and hyponatremia: Given the clinically apparent dehydration, the slight
hyponatremia and hypochloremia are likely due to loss of electrolytes in marginal excess of
water. This may occur with acute renal failure or vomiting. Third space losses such as
uroabdomen can also result in these electrolyte changes and the integrity of the urinary
bladder should be evaluated. The decrease in chloride on Day 1 is slightly greater than the
decrease in sodium, suggesting that the acid/base status should be evaluated. The combination
of hyponatremia, hypochloremia and hyperkalemia is compatible with hypoadrenocorticism, but
this syndrome is rare in cats and not in keeping with the history and physical examination.


Hyperkalemia: Hyperkalemia is associated with renal disease characterized by inability to
eliminate urine, whether from urethral blockage, uroabdomen, or oliguric/anuric renal failure.
Increased intake, oversupplementation, or drug effects are not compatible with the clinical
history. Translocation due to acute inorganic acidosis also appears unlikely. Translocation from
damaged tissue is possible given the concurrent increase in AST and phosphorus.


HCO3 and anion gap: HCO3 is still within the normal reference interval but near the lower
end. Blood gas analysis indicated a persistent acidemia which is likely due to decreased renal
excretion of hydrogen ions secondary to obstruction or possibly uroabdomen. Lactic acidosis
may also contribute to the acidemia.


Hyperbilirubinemia: The cause for the hyperbilirubinemia is not apparent; its significance is
unclear given the substantial decrease observed in 24 hours. In general, causes for hyperbilirubinemia include hemolysis, cholestatic liver disease, liver failure, and sepsis. The potential for
hemolytic disease cannot be assessed in the absence of CBC data. CBC data would also help
determine if sepsis is an important differential diagnosis. Poor perfusion of the liver secondary
to dehydration and impaired circulation may contribute to liver hypoxia and impaired function.
At this point, significant liver disease seems unlikely given the normal ALP, GGT, and ALT,
although no specific tests of liver function have been performed.


Increased AST: This increase is mild and is not accompanied by an increased ALT, making liver
a less likely source of this enzyme. Hemolysis or muscle damage are possible sources of the
increased AST. Measurement of CK could help substantiate the presence of muscle damage,
which may result from a variety of causes including damage/trauma to the urinary tract, invasive
medical procedures, or hypoperfusion.


Hypercholesterolemia: The hypercholesterolemia is mild, however it may be a marker for
various metabolic derangements, endocrinopathies, and hepatic or renal disease (See Chapter
3). Like hyperbilirubinemia, this abnormality appears to be resolving and should be monitored
over time.


Additional Clinical Information and Case Outcome
A urinary catheter was placed with some difficulty because of accumulation of gritty


crystalline material in the urethra. Simba underwent surgery to remove three 2 mm calculi
from the urinary bladder and was treated post-operatively with fluids and antibiotics. Simba
did not eat well in the hospital and was discharged a day early because of concern that he
might be developing hepatic lipidosis.


Day 2 Serum Biochemical Profile:
Hyperglycemia: The mild hyperglycemia present on Day 2 is likely due to stress or may be
secondary to supplementation in intravenous fluids.


Azotemia: While serum creatinine has decreased into the normal range, BUN is still mildly
increased, and there may be some renal parenchymal damage post obstruction. The
minimally concentrated urine is compatible with a post-obstructive diuresis.


Hypocalcemia: By Day 2, the phosphorus has normalized due to the diuresis. The calcium is
still slightly low which may be due to the hypoalbuminemia and a subsequent a decrement in
protein bound calcium.


Hypoproteinemia: The hypoalbuminemia has worsened by Day 2 and may reflect dilution of
an already low protein by intravenous fluids. Because of the potential proteinuria and residual
renal parenchymal damage following obstruction, urinalysis and urine protein:creatinine ratios
should be monitored in the future.


Hypochloremia: By Day 2, the mild hyponatremia has been corrected, and there is a disproportionate hypochloremia. If there is not apparent cause of excessive loss of chloride via
gastric vomiting, an acid/base derangement may be the cause of the low chloride.


Hyperkalemia followed by hypokalemia: Serum potassium does not accurately reflect total
body potassium, and rapid changes in potassium over time may occur associated with
changes in renal tubular flow rates and fluctutations in acid/base status. On Day 2, urine flow
has been re-established, and Simba is experiencing post-obstructive diuresis with kaliuresis.


HCO3 and anion gap: The increased HCO3 in combination with hypochloremia could
indicate a mixed acid/base disorder. The low anion gap on day 2 probably reflects hypoproteinemia, while the markedly increased HCO3 suggests alkalemia. The dramatic change in
acid/base status over one day in this case is due to overzealous administration of sodium
bicarbonate in response to the previous acidemia.
