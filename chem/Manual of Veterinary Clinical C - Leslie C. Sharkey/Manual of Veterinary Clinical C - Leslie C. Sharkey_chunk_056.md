Hypermagnesemia: Like phosphorus, serum magnesium levels will increase as glomerular
filtration rate declines. In general, furosemide causes decreased serum magnesium. Severe
rhabdomyolysis can lead to extracellular release of magnesium.


Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: The most likely cause of the hyponatremia in this case is
the diuretic therapy and resultant water and electrolyte wasting by the kidneys. The
corrected chloride indicates that the proportional decrease in chloride is greater than that of
sodium, suggesting the potential for an acid/base disturbance.


Hyperkalemia: Both diuretics and the polyuric phase of chronic renal failure usually result in
increased renal losses of potassium and hypokalemia. Hyperkalemia may develop when urine
production decreases in oliguric or anuric renal failure, which is possible with the history of
decreasing frequency of urinations and a small urinary bladder despite diuretic therapy.
Because of the history of thromboembolic disease and the concurrent elevations in
phosphorus, magnesium, and CK, tissue necrosis should be considered a potential cause for
the hyperkalemia in this patient. An unlikely possibility is hypoadrenocorticism, which can be
characterized by hyponatremia, hypochloremia and hyperkalemia with azotemia and
inadequately concentrated urine (See Chapter 5, Case 23).


Decreased HCO3 and increased anion gap: This is compatible with metabolic acidosis
associated with accumulation of unmeasured anions, such as uremic acids. In general, the
chloride will vary inversely with the HCO3, which is not the case in this patient and a mixed
acid/base disorder may be present. Blood gas analysis may be required for full characterization of the acid/base status. The history of cardiopulmonary disease and thromboembolic
disease indicates that a respiratory component is likely.


Hypercholesterolemia: There are numerous potential causes for hypercholesterolemia in
small animal patients, including metabolic disorders and endocrinopathies. In this case,
hypercholesterolemia is probably associated with the renal disease.


Increased Creatine Kinase: This is evidence for muscle degeneration or necrosis, and raises
the possibility of another episode of thromboembolic complications of the cardiac disease.


Urinalysis: The 2+ protein in dilute urine with an inactive sediment is compatible with
glomerular loss of protein. A urine protein:creatinine ratio is recommended to further
evaluate urinary protein losses. Given the inactive sediment in this case, the proteinuria is
unlikely to be the result of blood contamination or lower urinary tract disease. Significant
glomerular protein loss is not always associated with hypoalbuminemia because of the
capacity of a healthy liver for compensatory upregulation of albumin production. Dehydration
can also mask hypoproteinemia, which may be the case in this patient since the serum
albumin is just at the lower end of the reference interval.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Despite aggressive therapy, Zinger stopped producing urine and was euthanized. No
necropsy was performed, but it was strongly suspected that acute renal failure could have
been precipitated by additional thromboembolic episodes. The presence of hyperphosphatemia, hypermagnesemia, and hyperkalemia could be explained by the oliguric renal
failure alone, however they are also compatible with tissue necrosis associated with ischemic
damage to tissues. The high CK supports this interpretation, however CK can also be
elevated in cats with urinary obstruction. If Zinger did develop a protein-losing nephropathy,
loss of endogeneous anticoagulant proteins such as antithrombin III could have contributed
to his predisposition to the abnormal formation of blood clots within his vasculature. This
case can be compared with Lolita (Case 4), in which rhabdomyolysis resulted in elevated
serum phosphorus and CK. Lolita had no evidence of renal disease at presentation, however.


Case 16 – Level 3
“Diva” is 5-year-old spayed female domestic short haired cat. After being missing for seven
weeks, she was found in a garage. On presentation, she is obtunded, hypothermic (<90°F),
bradycardic (30 bpm), and has very slow respiratory rate. Diva is cachectic and has lost
approximately half of her previous body weight. Diva is profoundly dehydrated and blood
pressure cannot be measured. She was immediately intubated for ventilation, and an
intraperitoneal bolus of warmed physiologic saline was administered. Diva was extubated
when she became responsive, and it was possible to collect blood samples for analysis and
begin intravenous fluid therapy. However, generalized seizures and tetany followed,
culminating in respiratory arrest with resuscitation. She was placed on a ventilator and
weaned off over night. Parenteral nutrition was initiated on Day 2, at which time Diva was
very weak but more stable. A transfusion was given on Day 3.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: At presentation, Diva has marked neutropenia, secondary to margination of neutrophils
associated with hypothermia. On day 3, there is a mild lymphopenia that could be
attributable to corticosteroid effects. The monocytopenia is of no clinical significance. There
is a normocytic normochromic anemia of variable severity throughout Diva’s hospitalization.
Some of the decrease between Day 1 and 3 is because of dilution following correction of
fluid deficits and dehydration. Anemia of chronic disease and chronic malnutrition are the
most obvious causes for this anemia, although the patient should also be evaluated for
fleas/ticks and gastrointestinal parasites that could further depress the PCV. There also may
be a hemolytic component as Heinz bodies were noted on Day 1. The clinical significance of
Heinz bodies in cats depends on the number and size of the Heinz bodies. Sick cats
frequently have small Heinz bodies that do not contribute significantly to development of
anemia. A transfusion on Day 3 caused the increased in PCV on Day 4.


Serum Biochemical Profile Day 1
Increased BUN with normal creatinine: Because of Diva’s extreme dehydration and poor
perfusion, no urine could be obtained prior to initiating therapy. Given the fluid deficits, the
increased BUN is very likely to reflect pre-renal factors. She should be monitored carefully for
signs of decreased renal function because her kidneys may have been damaged by
circulatory compromise of unknown duration. The marked muscle wasting associated with
starvation may result in a lower creatinine measurement than would be expected for the
degree of dehydration and pre-renal azotemia present in this patient.


Hypermagnesemia: This abnormality reflects the decreased glomerular filtration rate
secondary to dehydration.


Hypoproteinemia with hypoglobulinemia: These values are likely to be even lower once
fluid deficits are corrected, as seen on Day 3. Extreme food deprivation can result in
hypoproteinemia, and is likely the cause of Diva’s hypoproteinemia. Although most patients
with starvation have hypoalbuminemia and normal globulins (see Chapter 5, Case 3), this is
quite variable, and reversible hypoglobulinemia may occur (Kaneko). Other causes of
decreased globulin proteins include various immunodeficiency states that are unlikely in this
case. Increased losses of globulin proteins are generally commensurate with albumin wasting
associated with hemorrhage, body cavity effusions, gastrointestinal lesions, or diffuse
exudative dermal lesions (See Deputy, Case 14).


Increased ALP: There are fewer nonspecific causes of increased ALP in cats than dogs, and
liver pathology is possible in this patient. Given the extreme weight loss and normal GGT,
some degree of hepatic lipidosis is possible. Many cats with clinically significant hepatic
lipidosis also will have elevations in bilirubin and ALT, which Diva does not have. Other
considerations for this increase include poor perfusion, sepsis, trauma, or hyperthyroidism.
The latter is not as likely in a relatively young cat.


Increased AST: Increased AST most often indicates liver or muscle pathology, however the
ALT is not elevated to support hepatocellular damage. No CK levels are available to further
evaluate muscle status. As with the ALP, poor perfusion, trauma, sepsis, and hyperthyroidism
could elevate AST.


Serum Biochemical Profiles Days 3 and 4
Hyperglycemia: Carbohydrate intolerance and insulin resistance are frequently described
consequences of introducing nutritional support after a period of starvation, however the
mechanisms are not well understood (Brooks, Miller).


Low serum creatinine: This abnormality is likely related to the low muscle mass and
correction of dehydration.


Hypophosphatemia: Hypophosphatemia is the most consistent and classical abnormality
associated with the refeeding syndrome. Important mechanisms include decreased dietary
intake, ineffective gastrointestinal absorption (decreased absorptive surface area with villous
atrophy), and transcellular shift of phosphorus into cells (Miller). Respiratory, but not
metabolic alkalosis will also exacerbate transcellular shifts of phosphorus because of an
increased intracellular pH that activates glycolysis. Hypophosophatemia also has been
reported with diabetes mellitus and hepatic lipidosis in addition to enteral alimentation in
cats (Justin).


Hypocalcemia: This abnormality on Day 3 may be associated with the decreased albumin.
Hypoalbuminemia is not a consistent feature of refeeding syndrome.


Hypomagnesemia: Low magnesium is related to dietary deficiency in combination with renal
losses during catabolism of lean body mass. When nutritional support is implemented,
magnesium requirements will increase as tissues are repaired and replenished, further
draining already depleted body magnesium.


Hyponatremia may be the result of dilutional hyponatremia secondary to hyperglycemia in
which osmotic forces from the glucose pull water into the circulation. Starvation causes
sodium and water retention, however if water retention exceeds sodium retention, serum
sodium will decline. Fluid retention in combination with reduced heart mass secondary to
starvation can precipitate congestive heart failure in human patients. Obvious routes of
excessive sodium loss are not present.


Hypochloremia and increased HCO3: Some of the decrease in chloride parallels changes in
sodium. The degree of hypochloremia is greater than the degree of hyponatremia, however,
suggesting the potential for acid/base abnormalities. The corrected chloride for Day 3 is 109
mEq/L and for Day 4 is 104 mEq/L. Diva has a hypochloremic alkalosis that could be
associated with gastric vomiting or diuretic therapy. Alkalosis has been described in human
patients with refeeding syndrome, however the mechanism is not clear.


Hypokalemia: Decreased dietary intake combined with insulin-stimulated cellular
translocation can cause severe hypokalemia in starved patients that are provided with
nutritional support.


Hyperbilirubinemia with increased ALP and AST: See Day 1 interpretation. The development
of hyperbilirubinemia could be related to cholestasis with hepatic lipidosis. This is associated
with a progressive rise in ALP. Severe hypophosphatemia may lead to hemolytic anemia,
however this generally occurs when the serum phosphorus levels are less than 1.0 mg/dl.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

By Days 3 and 4, the classical laboratory abnormalities of hypophosphatemia,
hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia signaled the development of refeeding syndrome, and
nutritional support was withdrawn until mineral and electrolyte imbalances could be
corrected. At that time a more conservative rate of support was reinitiated with thiamine
supplementation. By the second week of hospitalization, Diva was able to accept enteral
feeding and occasionally ate small amounts of food on her own and began physical therapy.
By the third week, Diva was still extremely weak, but was able to take a few steps on her own


and was discharged from the hospital to her owners to continue supportive care at home. A
recheck examination 10 days after discharge revealed progressively improved mobility and
appetite, however Diva was still slightly weak in her rear limbs.


Diva’s presentation illustrates the relatively mild serum biochemical abnormalities that
accompany even profound starvation. During starvation in humans, metabolism shifts from
being primarily dependent on carbohydrates to fat, with ketone bodies and free fatty acids
supplying most of the energy in the body. Insulin levels drop. When carbohydrates are
reintroduced during institution of nutritional support or “refeeding”, phosphorus,
magnesium, and potassium quickly translocate into cells, precipitating clinical signs related to
musculoskeletal and nervous system dysfunction. Thiamine depletion is also exacerbated by
increased demand associated with carbohydrate refeeding and this contributes to the
development of clinical signs (Crook). The extent to which these pathophysiologic processes
may be extrapolated to cats, which have a more protein-based metabolism is unclear (Zoran),
however this case does illustrate many similarities to what is reported in the human literature.
