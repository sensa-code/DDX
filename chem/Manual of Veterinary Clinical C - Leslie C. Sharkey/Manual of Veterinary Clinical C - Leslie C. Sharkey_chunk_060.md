potassium. Treatment with beta-blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
interferes with potassium excretion in the absence of renal disease. There is no evidence of
tissue trauma or acid/base abnormalities that would trigger translocation of potassium from
cells. In the context of the clinical history, uroabdomen seems unlikely, however measurement
of abdominal fluid creatinine could be performed to rule out this possibility.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Serengeti’s owners elected euthanasia because of financial concerns and the potential for
incurable disease. The clinical impression was that Serengeti’s effusion may have been due to
neoplasia, possibly carcinomatosis, however a primary mass could not be identified at
necropsy (Figure 7-1). Other findings at necropsy included membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (apparently subclinical, although no urinalysis was performed), choleliths, benign
prostatic hyperplasia, and massive fibrosis in the omentum. The fibrosis was accompanied by
neovascularization, necrosis, inflammation, and prominent atypical mesothelial cells. The
anatomic pathologist felt that this lesion was most likely related to a previous penetrating
wound of the gastrointestinal tract, however no injury or septic focus could be located.


This case illustrates two important principles. The first is that electrolyte abnormalities
classically associated with hypoadrenocorticism (see Chapter 5, Case 23; Chapter 6, Case 13;
Chapter 7 Case 3) or uroabdomen (Chapter 5, Case 18; Chapter 7, Cases 12 and 21) may
occur secondary to cavity effusions or gastrointestinal disease. The second is the difficulty
distinguishing reactive hyperplasia from neoplasia in tissues that are predisposed to marked
reactive changes. The final diagnosis in this case remained uncertain despite necropsy.

Case 4 – Level 1
“Cinder” is an 8-year-old neutered male Labrador Retriever presenting for progressive
lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. Last month, the owners noticed that he had difficulty
getting up and down the stairs, so the referring veterinarian recommended aspirin. Cinder
began vomiting when he was treated with aspirin, so the medication was changed to
carprofen, which seemed to work better. Two weeks ago, Cinder became anorectic and has
not been drinking much water. This morning he was very weak, began to vomit, and have
diarrhea. On physical examination, Cinder’s mucous membranes are markedly icteric, and he
is salivating. Capillary refill time and auscultation are normal. He does appear to be ataxic
and very weak.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Cinder has a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis and lymphopenia compatible with
corticosteroid effects with or without mild inflammation. The cause for nucleated erythrocytes
in this case is difficult to ascertain. Increased nucleated RBCs may accompany a regenerative
response, however, Cinder is not anemic. Nucleated RBCs may be present in the circulation
in association with endothelial cell damage or lesions in hematopoietic tissues such as the
bone marrow or spleen (Figure 7-2). They may also be seen in cases of lead intoxication.
When present in sufficient numbers, schistocytes indicate vascular pathology such as
disseminated intravascular coagulation (possible with the prolonged coagulation times and
slightly increased FDPs) or hemangiosarcoma, although they may also be noted with more
benign conditions such as iron deficiency.

Serum Biochemical Profile
Low BUN: Low BUN often reflects polyuria and polydipsia with increased renal tubular flow
rates, however Cinder’s clinical history does not include PU/PD. Low protein diets may also
contribute. Alternatively, decreased liver function can lower BUN. Other abnormalities of the
serum biochemical profile that sometimes accompany poor liver function include hypoglycemia,
hypoalbuminemia, and hypocholesterolemia. While all of these analytes are at the lower end of
their reference intervals, none are low at this time. Examination of other laboratory data shows
prolonged coagulation times, which could also support a diagnosis of impaired liver function.
Since none of these parameters are good indicators of liver function, measurement of blood
ammonia or serum bile acids is recommended. Ammonia would be preferred when there is
concurrent hyperbilirubinemia, because serum bile acid concentrations are expected to increase
with cholestasis regardless of liver function.


Hypoproteinemia with hypoglobulinemia: Hypoglobulinemia is most often associated with
concurrent hypoalbuminemia and reflects non-selective protein losses into the gut, third
space, through the skin, or with hemorrhage. In this case, the albumin (and hematocrit)
remains within the reference intervals, although the abnormal coagulation profile suggests
the potential for blood loss. Rarely, congenital immunodeficiency syndromes can result in
failure of globulin production, but this is unlikely in an 8-year-old dog.


Hypokalemia: Gastrointestinal losses of potassium coupled with inadequate intake combine
to cause Cinder’s hypokalemia.


Marked hyperbilirubinemia: The presence of schistocytes in the peripheral blood suggests the
potential for some hemolysis, however the normal hematocrit argues that hemolysis is minor
and could not account for all of the increase in bilirubin. The other major differential diagnosis
for hyperbilirubinemia is cholestasis, which is corroborated by the increased ALP, although this
change is mild and not accompanied by an increase in GGT. Decreased liver function and sepsis
may also cause increased serum bilirubin. Because of the low BUN and prolonged clotting
times, the potential for decreased liver function deserves further consideration.


Mildly increased ALP: There are many extrahepatic causes for increased ALP in the dog,
including corticosteroid effects which are suggested by the lymphopenia. Other
considerations include bone disease, endocrinopathies, and cholestatic liver disease. The
clinical history does not indicate a high degree of suspicion of bone disease, nor is the other
laboratory work compatible with endocrinopathies implicated in causing elevated ALP such
as hyperadrenocorticism or diabetes mellitus. Cholestatic liver disease seems logical given
the marked increase in bilirubin, however the minor elevation in ALP and normal GGT seem
inordinately low for cholestatic liver disease.


Increased ALT and AST: ALT generally suggests hepatocellular damage, but does not
indicate cause. AST is less liver specific and can reflect more generalized tissue damage,
especially if the ALT does not change proportionally. Hepatocellular damage could be
secondary to gastrointestinal pathology, however the high bilirubin suggests primary liver
disease must also be considered.


Coagulation profile: PT and APTT indicate a defect of secondary hemostasis. Common
considerations include decreased liver function, anticoagulant rodenticide intoxication, or
disseminated intravascular coagulation. All of these may be associated with mildly to
moderately increased fibrin degradation products because of either failure of clearance by a
dysfunctional liver or increased production associated with excessive breakdown of blood clots.


Urinalysis: Ammonion biurate crystals suggest liver dysfunction in dogs.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Cinder’s blood ammonia levels were within reference intervals. Because treatment with
carprofen has been associated with acute hepatic necrosis in dogs (MacPhail), a toxicity was
considered. Cinder was treated with plasma transfusions and vitamin K to prevent abnormal
bleeding. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a small, bright liver suggesting a chronic process
rather than acute toxicity. Progressive neurological signs developed, culminating in a
comatose state. Cinder’s owners elected euthanasia due to the poor prognosis. Necropsy
revealed marked progressive bridging portal fibrosis and stromal collapse with nodular
regeneration and intrahepatic cholestasis, compatible with the marked hyperbilirubinemia
documented on the serum biochemical profile. Autolysis precluded evaluation for acute
necrosis and documentation of any role for the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory treatment in


the progression of hepatic disease. In this case, the relatively minor elevations in both
cholestatic and hepatocellular enzymes may have reflected the small amount of residual
hepatic tissue.


Cinder’s only electrolyte abnormality was isolated hypokalemia, which is relatively common in
domestic animal species with gastrointestinal disease because of the combination of
increased losses and decreased intake, but may also be seen with polyuria and anorexia for
similar reasons (Chapter 3, Case19).

Case 5 – Level 1
“Fiero” is a 12-year-old spayed female Dachshund presenting for a one day history of
vomiting during which she could not hold down food or water. For the past 3-4 years, Fiero
has been treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor because of a heart
murmur. Her history also includes parathyroidectomy performed four months ago to correct
hypercalcemia. She has always shown a marked interest in garbage eating. On physical
examination, Fiero appears painful when her abdomen is palpated and is slightly dehydrated.
In the hospital, she has blood-tinged vomitus.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Fiero has a mild mature neutrophilia and lymphopenia, which suggests corticosteroid
effects. Eosinopenia is another relatively consistent feature of the steroid leukogram,
however some eosinophils were noted on the differential cell count. Given the dehydrated
state of the patient, the polycythemia is thought to be relative. This is not accompanied by
an increase in total protein. It is possible for dehydration to mask hypoproteinemia, and this
should be re-evaluated once the patient is rehydrated. Splenic contraction also is a possible
cause of an increase in PCV that would not be associated with an increase in total protein.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: If this finding is verified by repeat analysis to rule out processing errors,
several other possibilities for hypoglycemia should be considered. Hypoglycemia may be
associated with poor nutrition, and some sources indicate that small dogs are more prone to
develop hypoglycemia secondary to decreased food intake. In most cases, however, food
deprivation must be chronic and severe to cause hypoglycemia. Decreased production
associated with liver failure is possible, however other analytes produced by the liver such as
urea, albumin, and cholesterol remain within reference intervals at this time. Sepsis is another
potential cause for hypoglycemia, but not supported by changes on the leukogram.
Neoplasia is also a consideration in an older patient.


Hypochloremic alkalosis: With the clinical history of vomiting and Fiero’s affinity for trash
can dining, gastric vomiting could be a source of chloride and acid loss. The angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor may potentiate losses of sodium or chloride and promote
retention of potassium. Patients receiving medications that interfere with the function of the
renin angiotensin system should have their serum electrolytes periodically monitored and the
dose adjusted if necessary.


Increased ALP: As discussed in Chapter 2, increased ALP in the dog is a nonspecific change
that may be associated with drug effects, endocrinopathies, circulatory disorders, bone
pathology, and cholestatic liver disease. Severe cholestatic liver disease is less likely with a
normal bilirubin and GGT, and the history does not suggest a bone disorder, so
drug/endocrine effects or milder liver disease (possibly secondary to intestinal pathology) are
most likely in this patient.


Increased ALT: Although this is a mild elevation, it does indicate the potential for
hepatocellular damage and suggests that the increased ALP may reflect some hepatic
disease. The liver damage still may be secondary to intestinal inflammation, since liver
enzyme elevations do not distinguish between primary and secondary processes.
Endocrinopathies may cause increases in multiple hepatic enzymes.


Hyperamylasemia: Increased amylase is frequently interpreted to signal pancreatic disease
such as pancreatitis. This certainly could be compatible with Fiero’s clinical history, although
the clinical chemistry abnormalities are not classic for pancreatitis. Alternatively, serum
amylase may also increase in association with intestinal disease, which may be the case in this
patient. Two to three-fold increases in amylase can be the result of decreased glomerular
filtration rate. Although Fiero is not azotemic, she appears dehydrated, which may result in
pre-renal decreases in glomerular filtration rate.
