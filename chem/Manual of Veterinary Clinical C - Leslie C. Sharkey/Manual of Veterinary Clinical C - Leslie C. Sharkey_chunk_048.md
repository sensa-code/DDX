Hypokalemia: Low intake of potassium is a more likely factor for this electrolyte than for
sodium and chloride. Clinically significant hypokalemia is more likely if combined with
increased losses. Mechanisms for increased loss are similar to those described for NaCl and
include losses through the gastrointestinal tract, into third spaces and through the kidney.
Polyuric renal failure is often associated with hypokalemia as increased tubular flow rates
decrease the time available for potassium reabsorption. Treatment with insulin for
hyperglycemia or with sodium bicarbonate for acid/base abnormalities can cause
translocation of potassium into cells and result in hypokalemia. It should be noted that serum
levels of sodium, chloride, and potassium do not generally reflect total body stores.


Decreased HCO3 and increased anion gap: These findings indicate acidemia with increased
unmeasured anions. In this case, potential unmeasured anions include uremic acids and lactic
acids if there is decreased tissue perfusion. Exogeneous acids such as salicylates,
paraldehyde, and ethylene glycol can also increase the anion gap. Loss of bicarbonate rich
fluids such as saliva or in diarrhea is possible, and renal disease may compromise the kidney’s
ability to compensate for challenges to acid/base balance. Urine pH in ruminants is generally
alkaline, however the acid pH in this case is expected based on the decreased HCO3.


Increased AST and CK: The combination of these changes indicates muscle damage and is
compatible with the history of recumbency in this patient.


###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Based on all of the data, renal failure is the most likely diagnosis. Lucinda was initially anuric,
but a small amount of urine was eventually produced after treatment with furosemide and
dopamine. After one day of hospitalization, Lucinda suffered cardiac and respiratory arrest.
Clinical manifestations of renal failure are poorly documented in goats (Belknap), and even in
better studied species, clinical signs and laboratory abnormalities can vary markedly between
individuals in different stages of disease. The specific cause of renal failure can be impossible
to document based only on clinical pathology data or even with histology.


As with other species, a variety of toxins and infectious agents can cause renal failure. Goats
have indiscriminate eating habits and zinc toxicity and ingestion of oxalate containing plants
can cause renal damage. Although ruminants may be more resistant to ethylene glycol
toxicity than monogastric species because they can degrade oxalates, this toxicity has been
reported in the goat (Boermans). In this case, treatment with a nephrotoxic antibiotic and a
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory is likely to have caused or contributed to renal disease. The
toxicity of both of these drugs is exacerbated by dehydration, which is compatible with a
history of diarrhea and the high-normal PCV. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs interfere
with prostaglandin synthesis and result in impaired renal autoregulation of blood flow,
causing ischemic damage. Urinary GGT activity can be measured to support a diagnosis of
tubular damage.


Lucinda may be compared with several other patients of various species presenting with
renal failure (horse-Case 9, cat-Cases 10, 13, 17, dog-Cases 11, 14, 15, llama-Case 20). As
noted above, there is a great deal of individual variation in laboratory data between different
patients with renal failure. Some of this variation is species dependent, but much of which is
not. Length and severity of renal failure, concurrent disease processes, and treatment may
influence laboratory results.

Overview
Step 1: Is the patient azotemic?


Step 2: Determine if the patient has pre-renal, renal, or post-renal azotemia or a combination
of causes.


If the patient is azotemic with concentrated urine, pre-renal azotemia is likely (Case 1, 19).


If the patient is azotemic with isosthenuria, renal azotemia is possible (Case 9, 10, 11, 13,
14, 15, 17, 20, 21, 25). Pre-renal factors may exacerbate renal azotemia.


If there is evidence of fluid accumulation in the abdomen, an enlarged, firm bladder, or
urethral blockage, post-renal azotemia is possible (Case 2, 6, 7, 18).


Step 3: Determine if there are extra-renal influences on BUN, serum creatinine or urine
specific gravity that could complicate interpretation.


Nutritional factors (starvation, Case 3)


Hypercalcemia (lymphoma, Case 4)


Sepsis (septic abdomen, Case 8, pyometra, Case 24)


Liver disease (portosystemic shunt, Case 12)


Osmotic diuresis (diabetes mellitus, Case 22)


Medullary washout (hypoadrenocorticism, Case 23)


Step 4: Is there evidence of renal protein loss that could suggest glomerular disease (Cases 5
and 20)? Remember to rule out extra-glomerular protein loss in the urinary tract related to
inflammatory or neoplastic conditions (examine urine sediment).

##### Abnormalities of Calcium, Phosphorus, and Magnesium


Measurement of Calcium and Phosphorus
The calcium reported in the standard veterinary serum biochemical profile is the total
calcium, which is made up of biologically active ionized calcium (approximately 50% of the
total under normal circumstances), calcium complexed to anions such as citrate, bicarbonate,
lactate, or phosphate (approximately 5%), and protein-bound calcium that is associated
primarily with albumin and to a lesser extent, globulins (approximately 45%) (Rosol). Various
physiological parameters such as serum protein concentration and pH may influence the
proportions of the different fractions, and proportions may be unpredictable in some
conditions such as renal failure (Schenck). Some disease conditions may alter total serum
calcium, but not impact the biologically active fraction, whereas other conditions may be
characterized by normal total serum calcium but changes in the ionized fraction. Therefore, it
may be informative to measure ionized calcium in some patients. This requires specialized
sample handling and instrumentation (ion specific electrode).


Phosphorus is present in the serum and plasma in organic and inorganic forms, however clinical
assays reflect only the inorganic component. Like calcium, inorganic phosphorus exists either
free (55%), protein-bound (10%), or complexed to non-protein cations (35%) (Stockham).


Much of the total body magnesium is stored in bone, and most of the remainder is
intracellular; approximately 1% is present in extracellular fluid and can be measured. Like
calcium, a proportion of the total serum magnesium is bound to albumin or globulins, some
forms complexes with anions, and the biologically active ionized fraction predominates. Also
similar to calcium, the measurement of the ionized fraction is preferred under some
circumstances because the proportions of protein-bound, complexed and ionized magnesium
are not constant. Because specialized equipment is required, clinicians must often rely on
measurements of total magnesium.


Regulation of Calcium and Phosphorus
A complete discussion of the complex regulation of these minerals is beyond the scope of
this chapter, and the reader is referred to textbooks for more detail (Rosol, Stockham). Very
briefly, serum calcium and phosphorus levels reflect the balance of intake, absorption from
the gut or bone, excretion via the kidney, and cellular translocation. The regulation of
magnesium is less clear, however gastrointestinal disease and changes in renal function
impact intake and losses.


Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)
Parathyroid hormone secretion from the parathyroid gland is stimulated by low ionized calcium
levels in the blood. This hormone stimulates calcium reabsorption from bone and increases
absorption of dietary calcium from the intestines. In the kidney, PTH promotes reabsorption of
calcium, excretion of phosphorus, and formation of the active form of vitamin D (Calcitriol).


Calcitonin
Calcitonin secretion from the thyroid C cells is continuous under normal circumstances,
however secretion will be increased in response to hypercalcemia. Calcitonin decreases
reabsorption of calcium from bone, and inhibits renal production of the active form of vitamin
D to reduce serum calcium concentrations. Renal losses of calcium and phosphorus increase
in response to calcitonin.


Vitamin D
Vitamin D that is activated in the kidney increases serum calcium and phosphorus by
increasing intestinal absorption of both minerals and by working with PTH to promote bone


resorption. Macrophages in non-malignant granulomatous diseases may produce calcitriol,
which can cause hypercalcemia (Vasilopulos).


Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein (PTHrP)
PTHrP does not play an important role in normal calcium and phosphorus homeostasis in
adult animals, however it does contribute to hypercalcemia of malignancy, one of the most
common causes of hypercalcemia in domestic animals. It is present in multiple tissues at very
low levels in normal animals, but it can be produced in large quantities by some tumors. In
these patients, PTHrP stimulates PTH receptors and can result in severe hypercalcemia, which
will resolve with successful treatment of the malignancy.


Evaluation of Calcium and Phosphorus
Because of shared regulatory pathways, calcium and phosphorus are often evaluated
together, and causes of abnormalities may be categorized by the relationship between the
two analytes. For a given disease process, abnormalities of calcium tend to be slightly more
consistent than changes in phosphorus. As always, laboratory artifacts and processing errors
should be considered as potential causes of changes in calcium and phosphorus. Repeated
measurement on a fresh, properly collected sample is recommended prior to expensive or
invasive diagnostic work up of any laboratory abnormality in the absence of clinical signs
compatible with the abnormality. Also, as for any analyte, remember to consider the
influence of physiologic variables such as breed, age, or reproductive status on calcium and
phosphorus metabolism. Ancillary information from the clinical history, physical examination,
imaging studies and other clinical laboratory testing will often help determine the cause of
changes in calcium and phosphorus.


Many patients present with serum magnesium values outside the reference range, but are
not considered to have clinical signs specifically referable to hypo- or hypermagnesemia. The
clinical significance of these abnormalities is unclear because little data is available for
domestic animal species. Interest in evaluation of serum magnesium has been stimulated by
data in human patients suggesting that hypomagnesemia is a negative prognostic indicator
in critical care patients (Rubeiz). There is some data to suggest this may be true in cats (Toll).
In one study of horses with surgical colic, low ionized magnesium in the perioperative period
appeared to correlate with poor outcome (Garcia-Lopez). Total magnesium measurements
were not predictive in this study, and another study examining total serum magnesium in
hospitalized horses found that a low serum magnesium level was a positive predictor of
survival (Johansson).


Hypocalcemia with Normal Phosphorus
Step 1: Is there hypoalbuminemia? This is a common cause of low serum total calcium
because a significant portion of total calcium is bound to plasma protein. Hypocalcemia
attributable to low protein is unlikely to cause clinical signs because biologically active
ionized calcium is usually normal. (See Chapter 4 for causes of hypoalbuminemia)


Step 2: Is the patient periparturient or lactating? Additional demands for calcium during
pregnancy or lactation can lower both total and ionized calcium and may or may not be
associated with clinical signs in a variety of species (Fascetti).


Step 3: Is there evidence of pancreatic or gastrointestinal disease? Severe acute
pancreatitis has been associated with hypocalcemia in dogs. Hypocalcemia has been
reported in a high percentage of horses with enterocolitis.


Step 4: What is the nutritional status? Grass tetany in cattle may cause hypocalcemia, as
can blister beetle toxicosis in horses. Anorexia from any cause in ruminants can result in
hypocalcemia because of inadequate intake of calcium.


Step 5: Is the patient taking any medications? Some medications such as glucocorticoids,
some anticonvulsants, and chelating compounds can lower serum calcium. Check the
potential effects of any drugs or toxins that could impact calcium homeostasis. Performing a
serum biochemical profile on blood anticoagulated with chelators such as EDTA will cause an
artifactual and dramatic decrease in the measured calcium value.


Hypocalcemia with Hyperphosphatemia
Step 1: Is there evidence of renal disease? As noted in Chapter 5, calcium status is
unpredictable in many cases of renal disease in small animals, however phosphorus is
generally increased because of low glomerular filtration rate. Patients with protein losing
nephropathy may be hypocalcemic due to the selective loss of albumin in the urine.
Hypocalcemia may be noted in patients with renal failure due to ethylene glycol intoxication
because of chelation of calcium with oxalate, and hyperphosphatemia may be exacerbated
by the presence of phosphates in anti-freeze (see Chapter 5, Case 21). Renal secondary
hyperparathyroidism is characterized by low calcium and hyperphosphatemia. Acute renal
failure in horses may be associated with hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia (Carlson),
however chronic renal failure in the horse is frequently characterized by hypercalcemia and
hypophosphatemia (see Chapter 5, Case 9).


Step 2: Could the patient have hypoparathyroidism? In some patients, poor parathyroid
function may be related to hypomagnesemia, while in other cases it may be idiopathic (Beyer)
or related to immune-mediated destruction or surgical removal of the parathyroid glands.


Hypocalcemia with Hypophosphatemia
Step 1: Is the patient periparturient or lactating? In some cases these patients may have
normal phosphorus, however many cows with parturient paresis are also hypophosphatemic.
Clinical signs of hypocalcemia may vary with species (tetany in dogs and horses, paresis in
cattle). The presence of clinical signs may depend on other physiologic variables, such as
acid/base status, which may determine how much of the total calcium is in the biologically
active ionized form.


Step 2: Is the diet adequate, or is there evidence of poor intestinal absorption?
Malabsorption syndromes or anorexia could contribute to low serum calcium and
phosphorus, as can diets with inappropriate calcium:phosphorus ratios.
