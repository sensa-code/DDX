Hypocalcemia with Hypophosphatemia
Step 1: Is the patient periparturient or lactating? In some cases these patients may have
normal phosphorus, however many cows with parturient paresis are also hypophosphatemic.
Clinical signs of hypocalcemia may vary with species (tetany in dogs and horses, paresis in
cattle). The presence of clinical signs may depend on other physiologic variables, such as
acid/base status, which may determine how much of the total calcium is in the biologically
active ionized form.


Step 2: Is the diet adequate, or is there evidence of poor intestinal absorption?
Malabsorption syndromes or anorexia could contribute to low serum calcium and
phosphorus, as can diets with inappropriate calcium:phosphorus ratios.


Hypercalcemia with Normal to Low Phosphorus
Step 1: Is there neoplasia unrelated to the parathyroid gland? Hypercalcemia of
malignancy is most frequently associated with hematopoietic neoplasia, however it is also
common in patients with anal sac apocrine gland adenocarcinomas, squamous cell
carcinomas, and a variety of other tumors (Williams, Vasilopulos). Serum phosphorus is
generally low because PTHrP promotes phosphorus excretion in the kidney similar to PTH.
However, if renal failure develops secondary to the hypercalcemia, serum phosphorus levels
may increase. PTHrP measurements are often high, while PTH will be suppressed.


Step 2: Is there a tumor in the parathyroid gland? Parathyroid tumors may produce an
excessive amount of PTH, which increases serum calcium and suppresses serum phosphorus.


Hypercalcemia with Hyperphosphatemia
Step 1: Is there evidence of renal disease? As noted above, serum calcium values can be
unpredictable in renal failure, however phosphorus is often high because of decreased renal
clearance. In some patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy, the high ionized calcium levels
cause nephropathy, which results in elevated serum phosphorus.


Step 2: Has the patient been exposed to excessive amounts of Vitamin D (often found in
rodenticides or some toxic plants)? Excessive vitamin D will promote increased absorption of
both calcium and phosphorus. Renal damage may ensue, potentially causing further increases
in calcium and phosphorus. Rarely, granulomatous disease may result in excessive production of
Vitamin D.


Step 3: Does the patient have clinical signs or laboratory abnormalities compatible with
hypoadrenocorticism? Glucocorticoid deficiency may increase absorption of calcium in the gut
and kidneys. Most of this calcium is protein bound, and the increase is often mild, so clinical
consequences of hypercalcemia in these patients are minimal. Phosphorus increases because of
pre-renal decrements in glomerular filtration rate relative to hypovolemia.


Step 4: Does the patient have active bone formation or remodeling? Rapid bone growth
in young, large breed dogs or large animals can increase serum calcium and phosphorus (see
Chapter 2, Case 1). Bone remodeling associated with primary or metastatic tumors or
osteomyelitis may also alter mineral homeostasis, however not all patients with radiographic
evidence of bone lysis have alterations in serum calcium and phosphorus (see Chapter 2,
Case 3).


Normal Calcium with Hyperphosphatemia
Step 1: Does the patient have an identifiable cause for tissue destruction? Phosphate is a
major intracellular anion, and cell lysis associated with tissue trauma or muscle damage,
hemolysis, and rarely, treatment of hematopoietic tumors (tumor lysis syndrome) can release
large amount of phosphorus into the blood.


Step 2: Is the patient hyperthyroid? Feline hyperthyroidism may be associated with increased
serum phosphorus, possibly due to decreased losses.


Hypomagnesemia
Step 1: Is the patient hypoproteinemic? Because a significant proportion of serum magnesium
is bound to protein, low serum protein levels may cause total magnesium to be low but ionized
magnesium is likely normal.


Step 2: Does the patient have gastrointestinal disease? Low serum magnesium may be
associated with gastrointestinal disease in both small and large animal species, possibly due to
decreased absorption or increased losses (Johansson, Toll).


Step 3: Does the diet have adequate mineral content? This is rarely an issue in small animal
species on commercial diets, however sheep and cattle on all milk or other diets deficient in
minerals can lead to low serum magnesium. In some situations such as grass tetany, the diet
may be replete, however the magnesium does not appear to be adequately absorbed (Rosol).


Hypermagnesemia
Step 1: Evaluate renal function. The most likely cause of hypermagnesemia is decreased
glomerular filtration rate, although cows with parturient paresis may also have increased
magnesium. Excessive intake is possible.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: There are no abnormalities in the CBC


Serum Biochemical Profile
Severe hypocalcemia: The complete absence of clinical signs makes it very unlikely that this
is a true value. Processing error or artifact are likely.


Hyperkalemia: As for calcium, this value would be expected to be associated with clinical
signs if it were accurate. Recommend repeat analysis.


Hypomagnesemia: In the absence of clinical signs, the significance of this value is unclear.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

The combination of abnormalities in this sample is compatible with the effects of EDTA
anticoagulant, which contains potassium and chelates calcium and magnesium. It would
appear that a plasma sample had been used for the chemistry panel. A new sample was
collected in a red topped (serum) tube, and all values were within reference intervals.

“Daisy” is a 5-year-old Holstein cow in her third lactation. She has a history of uneventful
calvings, including twins last year. A fetotomy was performed two nights ago, and the
placenta was subsequently delivered normally. However, Daisy was unable to rise after calving.

###### **Interpretation**

Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: The most likely cause for this relatively mild abnormality is stress, or possibly
early sepsis. CBC data or fibrinogen concentration would be helpful to further assess the
potential for an inflammatory condition. Diabetes mellitus is rare in large animal species.


Hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia: Recumbancy in a periparturient, high-producing
dairy cow should prompt evaluation for bovine parturient paresis (milk fever). The
hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia noted here are compatible with that diagnosis. When
measured, serum magnesium is often elevated. Hypocalcemia occurs because of the acute
and extreme demand for calcium associated with onset of colostrum and milk production. It
is difficult for the body to compensate for such an increase in demand after the dry period,
when demand is low and intestinal absorption and bone resorption are likely to be low. As
noted in the introduction to the chapter, the ionized fraction of calcium is the biologically
active fraction, however only total calcium measurements are usually available under most
circumstances, so the appearance and severity of clinical signs may not vary directly with
total serum calcium measurements. Because of protein binding of calcium, serum albumin
and globulins influence total calcium measurements. Acid/base abnormalities that may occur
with concurrent gastrointestinal disease (such as stasis or obstruction) can also influence
ionized calcium levels and therefore the severity of clinical signs at a given total calcium
concentration. Serum phosphorus levels may be low because of decreased feed intake near
parturition and salivary losses of phosphorus. Low bone resorption can impair the ability to
maintain serum phosphorus levels in the normal range when there are acute increases in
demand at parturition.


Increased AST: Increased AST in a recumbent cow is likely due to muscle damage, which is
common in parturient paresis. This impression can be supported by measuring creatine
kinase, which is also often elevated in parturient paresis cases.


###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Daisy responded rapidly to treatment with intravenous calcium, which is often the case in
uncomplicated parturient paresis patients. Often, milk fever is diagnosed on the basis of
clinical signs and the characteristic rapid response to therapy, however collection of
pretreatment blood samples can be helpful in case the patient does not respond to
appropriate therapy within a reasonable amount of time. Other conditions associated with
hypocalcemia in cows include uterine prolapse, dystocia, retained fetal membranes,
abomasal displacement, mastitis, renal disease, and metritis (Hunt).

↓

###### **Interpretation**

No CBC data is available.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Low BUN with normal creatinine: Low protein diets, polyuria/polydipsia, and poor liver
function may all cause low BUN with normal creatinine. In the absence of clinical signs or
other laboratory data supporting these causes, the low BUN in this case is of questionable
clinical significance.


Hypocalcemia (both total and ionized) with normal phosphorus: In this case, mild hypoalbuminemia may account for part, but not all of the low total calcium. In addition, ionized
calcium usually is normal in cases of hypocalcemia secondary to low albumin. The muscle
tremors strongly suggested ionized hypocalcemia, which was confirmed by laboratory
measurement. Eclampsia is a potential cause for low ionized calcium in periparturient female
dogs, but is not a consideration for Bear. With a history of vomiting and diarrhea, pancreatitis
is a differential diagnosis, however the hypocalcemia in these patients is generally mild and


does not produce clinical signs. Renal disease can be associated with hypocalcemia, however,
Bear is not azotemic. A urine specific gravity is needed to help assess renal function.
Hypoparathyroidism is rare in dogs and cats, but is compatible with the clinical signs and
relative absence of other serum biochemical abnormalities seen in Bear. In many cases of
hypoparathyroidism, the serum phosphorus is increased because low levels of PTH lead to
phosphorus retention by the kidney. Serum phosphorus may remain within the reference
interval in some cases because of relatively wide reference ranges or because of concurrent
phosphate depletion associated with anorexia. Serum PTH levels should be low in cases of
hypoparathyroidism. Hypomagnesemia can cause hypocalcemia by interfereing with PTH
secretion or function, however the serum magnesium is normal in this case. Keep in mind
that, like calcium, this is a total magnesium concentration and the ionized magnesium is the
biologically active form, which could be measured if necessary.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Bear was treated with calcium and Vitamin D supplementation, which increased his ionized
calcium levels and improved his clinical signs. His PTH levels were low at 1.5 pmol/L
(reference interval = 2-13), supporting the diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism.
Hypoparathyroidism may follow injury of the parathyroid glands during surgical procedures in
the neck or may be secondary to immune-mediated destruction of the gland.
