Abdominal fluid analysis
Pre-spin: light red and hazy
Post-spin: colorless and clear
Total protein: <2.0 gm/dl
Total nucleated cell count: 391/µl
The fluid contains small numbers of erythrocytes and nucleated cells.
Nondegenerate neutrophils predominate, with lesser numbers of
macrophages and occasional small lymphocytes. No etiologic agents
are seen.


Urine specific gravity: 1.011

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: No abnormalities noted.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Elevations in serum glucose in the horse are most often caused by excitement
or stress with increases in endogenous catecholamines and glucocorticoids. No changes in the
CBC are noted to explain the hyperglycemia such as a mature neutrophilia and lymphopenia
with corticosteroid effect or a mature neutrophilia and lymphocytosis with epinephrine.


Azotemia: The combination of increased BUN and creatinine with isosthenuria is indicative of
renal azotemia in the absence of any extra-renal factors that could interfere with urinary
concentrating ability. Isosthenuria alone in a well hydrated patient can be a normal finding.


Hypercalcemia with hypophosphatemia: Because normal equine kidneys excrete large
quantities of calcium, decreased glomerular filtration rate can result in hypercalcemia, especially
if dietary calcium is high. This is in contrast to the variable calcium measurements that
characterize renal failure in the dog and cat. Hypophosphatemia is often described in horses
with renal failure and may occur secondary to the hypercalcemia because of mass action. This is
in contrast to the hyperphosphatemia that often accompanies decreased GFR in other species.
PTH levels in horses with renal disease are reported to be suppressed (Brobstt) or variable
(Toribio).


Hyperproteinemia: Given that the serum albumin and globulins are both within reference
range, this finding is of questionable clinical significance.


Hypochloremia: The chloride is minimally decreased and is unlikely to be significant at this
time. Changes in chloride that are not proportional to sodium can be present if chloride losses
exceed sodium, or if there is an acid/base abnormality. In acid/base disturbances, the chloride
generally varies inversely with the bicarbonate, which is currently at the upper limit of the
reference range. The renal disease in this horse is a risk factor for the development of acid/base
abnormalities, so these analytes should be monitored.


Hyperkalemia: When the body cannot eliminate urine, potassium will be retained. This may
occur with post-renal azotemia or in the anuric/oliguric phase of renal failure. This is in contrast
to the polyuric phase of renal failure, in which increased tubular flow rates promote potassium
wasting because of decreased time for reabsorption. As has been noted for other cases with
hyponatremia/hypochloremia/hyperkalemia, hypoadrenocorticism is a differential diagnosis and
may be evaluated by performing an ACTH stimulation test; however this is unlikely in the horse.


Abdominal fluid analysis: The fluid is a transudate and is considered to be normal.


###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Margarite was treated with intravenous fluids and phosphorus, but she continued to produce
only small amounts of urine. The day after presentation, Margarite developed ventral edema,
so intravenous fluid administration was reduced and diuretics were administered. The next
day she became anuric and began to accumulate fluid in the abdominal cavity and pleural
space. Ultrasound of the kidneys showed advanced hydronephrosis in the right kidney and a
severely dilated ureter. The left kidney was small and hyperechoic with a dilated renal pelvis.
Margarite was euthanized because of anuria, anorexia, and poor long-term prognosis.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Lymphopenia could be compatible with stress/corticosteroid effects. Tramp has a
normocytic, normochromic anemia which will be somewhat more severe when fluid deficits
are corrected. Non-regenerative anemia is common in patients with chronic renal failure
because of low renal production of erythropoietin and the effect of uremic toxins on
erythropoiesis. Poor nutritional status may also exacerbate these anemias. If leukocyte and
platelet numbers are adequate, a bone marrow evaluation is not indicated because a
peripheral etiology for the anemia is present.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia: Azotemia with isosthenuric urine supports renal failure, and there is no evidence
of post-renal disease such as fluid in the abdomen, a large, firm bladder, stranguria or failure
to urinate. Because the patient is significantly dehydrated, there is likely pre-renal azotemia in
addition to renal azotemia.


Hyperphosphatemia and normal calcium: The most likely cause of hyperphosphatemia in
this patient is decreased glomerular filtration rate, regardless of whether the decreased
glomerular filtration rate is due to pre-renal, renal, or post-renal causes. Small animal patients
in renal failure may have high, normal, or low serum calcium levels, and ionized calcium levels
may not correlate with total calcium levels. Ionized calcium measurements should be
performed if there are clinical signs compatible with hypocalcemia.


Hypermagnesemia: Increased serum magnesium, like hyperphosphatemia, is the result of
decreased glomerular filtration rate.


Hyperproteinemia due to hyperalbuminemia: The liver does not over-produce albumin, so
this value is interpreted to support the clinical observation of dehydration.


Hypokalemia: Increased renal losses of potassium due to polyuria are compounded by low
intake associated with anorexia. Hypokalemia itself can result in renal disease, which may be
characterized by renal vasoconstriction and decreased glomerular filtration rate, polydipsia
and polyuria because of increased angiotensin II, and refractoriness to vasopressin.
Correction of potassium depletion may reverse some of these changes and improve urinary
concentrating ability.


Decreased HCO3: This indicates acidemia, which is frequently observed in patients with
renal failure. Often this change is associated with increased anion gap due to the presence of
uremic acids, which are unmeasured anions. Anion gap is normal in this case. Decreased
distal sodium reabsorption in response to potassium depletion will conserve hydrogen and
potassium because of the presence of a more positive charge in the tubular luminal fluid,
impairing acid excretion and leading to acidemia.


Hypercholesterolemia: Increases in cholesterol have been described in dogs with glomerular
nephritis and in dogs with nephrotic syndrome. The mechanism for hypercholesterolemia in
nephrotic syndrome may be increased hepatic synthesis, and these patients often have an
inverse relationship between albumin and cholesterol, although this is not present in this cat.
Abnormal lipoprotein lipase function related to inadequate amounts of its co-factor, heparan
sulfate, may also contribute to the hypercholesterolemia in nephrotic syndrome.


Increased amylase: Decreased glomerular filtration rate will increase amylase in the absence
of pancreatic disease. Amylase is a poor indicator of pancreatic pathology in cats.


Urinalysis: Small amounts of protein and heme could be compatible with mild blood
contamination if the sample was obtained by cytocentesis. A positive reaction for heme may
occur with free hemoglobin or the presence of erythrocytes in the urine sediment. However it
may not be possible to make this distinction because erythrocytes may lyse in urine with a
low specific gravity. Renal failure is associated with variable degrees of proteinuria.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Tramp was not hospitalized, but was sent home on management with subcutaneous fluids, a
renal failure diet, and potassium supplementation. Chronic renal failure patients may remain
stable for unpredictable amounts of time with supportive therapy. Comparison of Tramp with
Margarite (Chapter 5, Case 9) illustrates important species differences in calcium and
phosphorus responses to renal failure. Horses often present with increased calcium and normal
or low phosphorus depending on diet, while dogs and cats often present with variable calcium
levels and hyperphosphatemia.


On the other hand, Margarite’s hyperkalemia reflects decreased urine production and
retention of potassium while Tramp’s hypokalemia is characteristic of the polyuric phase of
renal failure. These are relatively consistent findings across species.


Case 11 – Level 2
“Joe” is a 9-year-old castrated male Yorkshire Terrier presenting for ingestion of between 4 and
8 200 mg tablets of ibuprofen. His owner came home from work and found multiple piles of
vomitus throughout the house. Joe appeared disoriented and was growling. On presentation,
Joe’s physical examination was unremarkable other than pain on abdominal palpation.

###### **Interpretation**

PCV: The patient is not initially anemic, however marked anemia develops over the next
several days. While chronic renal disease can be associated with the development of nonregenerative anemia due to failure of erythropoietin production and the impact of uremic
toxins on the marrow, this is less likely with acute renal compromise and generally develops
more slowly as senescent erythrocytes fail to be replaced by adequate erythropoiesis.
Because panhypoproteinemia is developing along with the anemia, blood loss anemia should


be considered likely. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen may
cause gastrointestinal ulceration and hemorrhage. They may also impair platelet function,
which could exacerbate bleeding (Tomlinson). Gastrointestinal ulcers and thrombocytopathy
also characterize uremia and may contribute to hemorrhage. Indices and reticulocyte counts
are not available to assess the erythropoietic response. It is anticipated that it would take 3-5
days before a significant reticulocytosis would be detected in response to hemorrhage. A
regenerative response may be blunted due continued loss of iron with external hemorrhage
and impaired erythropoietin release by the damaged kidneys.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: This change is likely related to stress.


Azotemia: Azotemia with isosthenuria suggests renal disease if there are no other factors
such as medullary washout or osmotic diuresis that could impact urinary concentrating ability.
The urinalysis on Day 1 indicates glucosuria, which can cause osmotic diuresis. Although the
blood glucose level is high, it does not exceed the renal tubular maximum for glucose
reabsorption, suggesting that there may be some renal tubular damage or dysfunction. The
azotemia worsens despite aggressive fluid therapy on Day 3, however by Day 4 values begin
to decline. On Day 4, the BUN remains high despite a normal serum creatinine. This can
sometimes occur gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which is strongly suspected given the
ibuprofen intoxication and declining PCV and protein values. Other causes of an increased
BUN with a normal creatinine include early pre-renal azotemia (unlikely here) or with a high
protein diet.


Hyperphosphatemia: On presentation, phosphorus levels are normal. Hyperphosphatemia
develops on Day 3 as renal function and glomerular filtration rate decline.


Hypocalcemia: The hypocalcemia may be explained, in part, by the concurrent hypoalbuminemia and would not be expected to result in significant changes in ionized calcium.
Hypocalcemia is seen in some patients with renal failure, generally attributed to
calcium/phosphorus mass law interactions secondary to elevated phosphorus, although the
phosphorus is not markedly elevated in this case. Inadequate calcitriol, leading to skeletal
resistance to parathryroid hormone and deficient intestinal absorption of calcium also
appears to play a role in the hypocalcemia that may develop with renal failure. These patients
usually do not have clinical signs associated with hypocalcemia, although symptoms may be
more common in dogs with acute renal failure or ethyelene glycol poisoning. Measurement
of ionized calcium should be considered.
