Increased AST and CK: Elevations in both of these enzymes suggest muscle damage and are
compatible with Salty’s travel history and episodes of recumbency.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

During induction of anesthesia in preparation for surgery, Salty suffered respiratory arrest,
became non-responsive, and was humanely euthanized. A limited necropsy revealed severely
gas-distended large bowel and a 360 degree torsion of the large colon at the base of the
cecum. Both arterial and venous supply was compromised, and the mucosa was black,
compatible with ischemic necrosis.


Serum albumin levels in horses with intestinal disease may be high, low, or normal. Multiple
factors may influence serum albumin in these cases, including fluid and protein loss in the gut
or the abdominal cavity, in combination with the effects of fluid therapy. Concurrent
electrolyte losses by similar mechanisms may also be present. Sweating can affect electolyte
concentrations and hydration status.


Case 10 – Level 3
“Twister” is a 9-year-old spayed female Brittany Spaniel with a history of histologically
confirmed chronic intestinal lymphangiectasia that has been successfully managed with low
doses of corticosteroids. At the time of initial diagnosis 2 years ago, Twister had panhypoproteinemia, mildly elevated ALP (442 IU/L), ALT (174 IU/L), and hypomagnesemia (0.7 mg/dl).
Twister is presenting today following a two month history of weight loss. In the last week, she
has been anorexic and has vomited twice.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Lymphopenia may either be due to the effects of treatment with corticosteroids or
associated with loss through compromised intestines.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypocalcemia with normal phosphorus: Decreased total serum calcium is likely associated
with hypoalbuminemia, however decreased ionized calcium has been described in association
with malabsorptive intestinal disease (See Case 4, Red Molly). Corticosteroids may also lower
calcium.


Panhypoproteinemia: With Twister’s clinical history, progression or acute exacerbation of the
pre-existing lymphangiectasia is the most obvious cause for the panhypoproteinemia.
Nutritional factors can contribute to hypoproteinemia if starvation is severe or prolonged and
associated with poor body condition. Decreased liver function could impair Twister’s ability to
produce sufficient albumin to compensate for ongoing losses. Low-normal BUN and mild
hyperbilirubinemia may occur with impaired hepatic function. Her liver enzymes are elevated
compared to the earlier values determined at the time of initial diagnosis which could
indicate liver pathology. The potential for the enzyme changes to be related to corticosteroid
therapy-induced hepatopathy should be considered.


Hyperbilirubinemia: The high-normal hematocrit and relatively normal leukogram indicate
that hemolysis and sepsis respectively, are unlikely causes of hyperbilirubinemia. Elevated
ALP and GGT suggest cholestasis, but may also be influenced by the presence of
corticosteroid hepatopathy. Corticosteroid effects alone are unlikely to explain the hyperbiluribinemia, and causes of cholestasis should be evaluated.


Increased ALP and GGT: As indicated above, both cholestasis and corticosteroid effects may
be increasing the amount of these enzymes in the circulation.


Increased ALT and AST: Increases in these enzymes indicate hepatocellular damage, but do
not suggest the cause. In some patients with cholestasis, hepatocellular damage may occur
secondary to the toxic effects of bile on the hepatocytes (see Chapter 2). Intestinal disease
can be associated with increased liver enzymes because the anatomic relationship between
the gut and the liver allow greater exposure of hepatocytes to bacteria, toxins, or
inflammatory cytokines from compromised bowel. Twister originally presented with elevated
ALP and ALT. These values are higher now and may indicate progression of the original
disease or additional pathologic processes. Pancreatic disease, suggested by the markedly
elevated lipase, can also cause secondary liver damage.


Hyperlipasemia with normal amylase: Both amylase and lipase levels in the blood may
increase 3-4 times normal when the glomerular filtration rate is decreased, however this is
unlikely in this patient as she is not azotemic. Administration of corticosteroids has been
reported to increase serum lipase in dogs up to 3-4 times the upper limit of the reference
interval with no significant change in amylase. While this is possible, the increase here
exceeds what has been associated with steroid use alone. Hyperlipasemia of 11-93 times the
upper limit of the reference range was reported in 6 dogs with tumors of the pancreas or
liver (Quigley), which could also account for the other enzyme elevations that are present in
this patient.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

The ultrasound study of Twister’s abdomen revealed multiple complex masses in the liver with
enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes and a thickened gastrointestinal tract. Aspiration cytology


of one of the liver masses was compatible with epithelial neoplasia, likely of biliary origin
(Figure 4-4) although no histology was available to confirm this impression. Twister was
euthanized because of deteriorating quality of life and poor prognosis.


Figure 4-4. Smears from the liver
mass contain clusters of cuboidal
epithelial cells characterized by
scant to moderate basophilic
cytoplasm and single round to oval
nuclei with coarsely stippled
chromatin. Cells occur in branching
papillary fronds. Cells appear to
have lost polarity and pile up in
disorganized masses. These
findings were compatible with
epithelial neoplasia, likely of bile
duct origin.


Twister’s data must be interpreted in the context of her previous diagnosis and therapy, both of
which could influence her clinical chemistry data. Her data at this second presentation are
significantly different from her initial values, which could be related to the effects of the corticosteroids or progression of disease. Unfortunately, the progression or resolution of clinical
signs do not always correlate with laboratory parameters. Some patients have good clinical
response to therapy with minimal changes in laboratory values, and some have no amelioration
of clinical signs despite improvement in laboratory abnormalities. Hence the saying, “treat the
patient, not the laboratory work.”


For Twister, the hyperbilirubinemia and the dramatic hyperlipasemia with normal amylase were
important pieces of information that indicated a new disease process should be considered
because they were not readily explicable by the previous disease or treatment. Paradoxically,
the normalization of the serum cholesterol may have been the result of increased production
secondary to cholestasis rather than decreased gastrointestinal loss following improvement of
the lymphangiectasia. This is potentially a patient in which two disease processes working in
opposition keep an analyte within the reference range despite significant pathology. This
phenomenon can sometimes be an issue in dehydrated hypoalbuminemic patients that initially
present with albumin in the normal range, or in hyperglobulinemic patients in which nonselective protein loss drops the globulin value down to within the reference interval.


Twister’s case can be compared with Case 4, Red Molly, who also had a protein losing
enteropathy with panhypoproteinemia, hypocalcemia, and hypocholesterolemia, however Molly
did not have associated liver enzyme elevations as a result of her intestinal disease. Two cases
from Chapter 3, have hyperlipasemia associated with pancreatic/hepatic neoplasia like Twister.
Shorty the cat (Chapter 3, Case 13) had pancreatic neoplasia with metastases to the liver,
however Shorty’s liver enzymes were within reference intervals, demonstrating that normal
clinical chemistry data cannot be used to rule out hepatic involvement. Muffy the dog (Chapter
3, Case 14) also had a pancreatic carcinoma, but her liver enzymes were elevated. Her liver
appeared normal by ultrasonography, however a biopsy was not performed to determine
whether the liver enzyme elevations were caused by metastatic disease or another process.
Neither Shorty nor Muffy were being treated with medications that commonly result in liver
enzyme elevations.

Case 11 – Level 3
“June” is a one-year-old spayed female domestic short haired cat presenting with a history of
chronic respiratory and sinus infections. On physical examination, June is thin, quiet, and
responsive. She is slightly hypothermic and has pale mucous membranes. While she has
obvious dyspnea and tachypnea, her right thorax is quiet on auscultation and 200 ml of
purulent fluid is removed. Blood is collected for analysis. She is placed in an oxygen cage
and treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. June suffers cardiopulmonary arrest
during chest tube placement, but is successfully resuscitated.

Description: There are massive numbers of degenerate neutrophils
with small numbers of macrophages. Large numbers of intracellular
and extracellular bacteria are present. While predominantly rod
shaped, bacteria are of mixed morphology with long, short, and
chaining organisms noted. Both Gram positive and negative organisms
are present.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: June has a neutrophilic leukocytosis with an extreme left shift and marked toxic change
compatible with severe inflammation; the focus is assumed to be the thoracic cavity based on
the gross appearance of the fluid removed via thoracocentesis. The mature lymphocytosis
may be attributable to either epinephrine effects or antigenic stimulation, although no
reactive cells are described to differentiate between the two mechanisms. June has a
normocytic, normochromic, nonregenerative anemia. This is most likely anemia of
inflammation, however the hematocrit is slightly lower than is typical for anemia of
inflammation. Increased numbers of nucleated red blood cells may be part of a regenerative
response to anemia or may reflect increased release secondary to endothelial damage in
hematopoietic organs. Endothelial damage is likely given the severity of inflammation and
the septic focus in the thorax.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: If processing errors are eliminated, the hypoglycemia is explained by sepsis.


Increased BUN with low creatinine: Decreased glomerular filtration or slow renal tubular
flow rates increasing available time for reabsorption of urea could explain the increased BUN.
No urine specific gravity is available to evaluate renal function because June had a small
urinary bladder at presentation and did not produce sufficient urine for collection until after
therapy was instituted. Sepsis may also increase the BUN because of intensified protein
turnover. The low creatinine may be due to low muscle mass.


Hypocalcemia with hyperphosphatemia and hypermagnesemia: Low serum albumin explains
the mild decrease in calcium because of a decrease in the protein bound fraction in the blood.
This is unlikely to impact the biologically active ionized fraction and therefore should not cause
clinical signs. If clinical signs suggestive for hypocalcemia develop, ionized calcium should be
measured. In the context of the clinical presentation and increased BUN, hyperphosphatemia
and hypermagnesemia are related to decreased glomerular filtration rate.


Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia and normal globulins: Hypoalbumiemia could be
due to decreased production and/or increased losses. Poor body condition suggests that


could also contribute, however no specific tests of liver function were performed to evaluate
this possibility. Decreased liver function can result in hypoglycemia and hyperbilirubinemia,
however both of these abnormalities can also be explained by sepsis. Albumin production in
a healthy liver may be downregulated in response to inflammation because albumin is a
negative acute phase reactant. Third space loss of protein into the effusion may be
decreasing both albumin and globulin since it is a non-selective site of protein loss. The
potential for renal loss of protein cannot be evaluated without a urinalysis. With nonselective
protein loss, globulins may be maintained within the normal range by increased production
secondary to antigenic stimulation.


Hyponatremia with proportional hypochloremia: These are mild changes of questionable
clinical significance, but are likely present because of electrolyte losses into the thoracic effusion.


Hyperbilirubinemia: Sepsis, liver disease, and hemolysis may all be factors in causing June’s
hyperbilirubinemia. Significant cholestatic liver disease is ruled out based on the normal ALP
and GGT. Hemolytic anemias are typically regenerative given sufficient time, and June’s anemia
is non-regenerative at presentation, making this less likely than sepsis and liver disease as causes
for this abnormality.
