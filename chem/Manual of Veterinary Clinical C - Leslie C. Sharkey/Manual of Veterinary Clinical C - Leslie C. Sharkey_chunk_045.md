Case 21 – Level 3
“Brianna” is a 1.5-year-old intact female toy poodle presenting with a 2-day history of
vomiting bile, lethargy, and anorexia. Her last heat was 2 months ago. Brianna is a show dog
with no previous health problems and she is in good body condition. On physical examination,
Brianna is 8% dehydrated and hypothermic. Abdominal palpation appears to be painful,
especially in the peri-renal area. Owners report that Brianna chews many foreign objects.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Brianna has a mild mature neutrophilic leukocytosis which could be compatible with mild
inflammation. Correction of the dehydration may lower the PCV and could result in mild anemia.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia: Azotemia in a dehydrated patient with minimally concentrated urine indicates
decreased renal function. In dehydrated patients, pre-renal azotemia may complicate renal
azotemia. The potential for congenital renal disease and toxin exposure should be carefully
evaluated in young patients with evidence of renal failure.


Hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia: Hyperphosphatemia in this case is most likely due
to decreased glomerular filtration rate from both renal and pre-renal causes. Calcium levels
are variable in renal failure and total values may not correlate with ionized calcium as they
often do in patients with normal renal function (see Chapter 6). Hypocalcemia may occur
secondary to hyperphosphatemia. Acute renal failure can result in more pronounced
hypocalcemia than chronic renal failure because of inadequate time for physiologic
compensation. Early effects of ethylene glycol intoxication can include hyperphosphatemia
because of the high content of this mineral in the antifreeze fluid. Calcium may be chelated
by metabolites of ethylene glycol resulting in hypocalcemia.


Hypochloremia and increased anion gap: Hypochloremia in the absence of hyponatremia
may be due to disproportionate loss of chloride with vomiting. Hypochloremia can also be
associated with acid/base abnormalities, although the HCO3 in this case is within reference
range. Because the elevated anion gap indicates increased unmeasured anions, the normal
HCO3 could be compatible with a mixed acid/base disturbance. Candidates for unmeasured
anions in this case include uremic acids, lactic acid (poor perfusion and dehydration), or
exogenous acids, including metabolites of ethylene glycol.


Hyperkalemia: Hyperkalemia is most often present in renal failure patients with low urine
output and reflects inadequate renal elimination of potassium.


Urinalysis: The heme and erythrocytes are probably evidence of mild blood contamination
during the cytocentesis procedure.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Brianna was treated for acute renal failure with intravenous fluids, diuretics, calcium,
antibiotics, and anti-emetics. Some decrease in her azotemia was achieved, however she
continued to be anorexic and the vomiting could not be controlled. She developed melena
four days into her treatment, and the owners elected euthanasia based on her poor response
to therapy and prognosis. On necropsy, Brianna’s lungs were edematous and the kidneys were
congested and bulged on cut surface. Histologic examination of the kidneys revealed acute
tubular necrosis and the presence of light green polarizing crystals, consistent with ethylene
glycol intoxication. Examination of other organs did not reveal significant abnormalities.


The presence of calcium oxalate crystals can aid in confirming a diagnosis of ethylene glycol
intoxication, however they are not always present, especially several days after exposure to
the toxin. Similarly, a commercially available kit can be used (Allelic Biosystems Ethylene
Glycol Test Kit, PRN Pharmacal, Inc., Pensacola, FL), however by 24 hours after toxin
exposure the test is no longer positive (Gaynor).


This case may be compared with Joe (Case 11), in which acute renal damage was caused by
ibuprofen toxicity. Joe appears to have milder disease and an earlier intervention than
Brianna, despite the fact that both patients were exposed to nephrotoxic substances. Joe’s
laboratory work is also complicated by the effects of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Sally (Case
14) suffered from acute renal damage secondary to heatstroke, and her serum biochemical
profile is similar to Brianna’s, however the degree of hyperphosphatemia is not as
pronounced. Note that the patients presenting with acute renal disease are not anemic, while
patients with more chronic renal disease often have non-regenerative anemia (Tramp, Case
10, Ziggy, Case 17, Forsythia, Case 20).

Case 22 – Level 3
“Gerhardt” is a 9-year-old miniature schnauzer who has been treated for diabetes mellitus for
the past 2 years. He was brought to the hospital for a glucose tolerance test as part of an
evaluation to assess control of his diabetes. The owners noted that for the last 2 weeks, he
has had a milky discharge from his right nostril and periodic epistaxis from the left nostril. On
physical examination, Gerhardt has bilateral cataracts and severe dental tartar. Lung sounds
are normal, but he has an enlarged right submandibular lymph node.

###### **Interpretation**

No CBC data are available


Serum Biochemical Profile:
Hyperglycemia: The hyperglycemia is compatible with the history of diabetes mellitus. In
Gerhardt’s case, a glucose tolerance curve revealed adequate glycemic control. As discussed in
Chapter 3, fructosamine could be measured as a longer-term indicator of glucose status.


Low BUN and creatinine: Decreased BUN may be related to inadequate hepatic production
of urea, which is unlikely in this case given the normal albumin and hypercholesterolemia.


More sensitive testing of liver function could include measurement of serum bile acids or
blood ammonia, but is not necessary in this case unless other clinical signs suggestive for
liver failure develop. In this case, osmotic diuresis caused by the glucosuria causes the
polyuria and decreased BUN. Polyuria and polydipsia increase renal tubular flow rates,
decreasing time for reabsorption of urea. This leads to increased renal losses of urea and
lower BUN. Decreased creatinine may reflect muscle wasting that can be associated with
diabetes. Decreased creatinine is not clinically significant, and is difficult to confirm because
of the effects of non-creatinine chromagens at low creatinine concentrations and because the
lower end of the reference range in most species is near the limit of analytical sensitivity of
the assay. Glucocorticoid administration has been reported to lower serum creatinine in
normal dogs (Braun), but there is no history of glucocorticoid therapy in this patient.


Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Lipemia can cause artifactually lower electrolyte values,
depending on the methodology used to measure these analytes. If an analyzer employs
indirect potentiometry with ion specific electrodes in which the sample is diluted as part of
the assay, artifactual lowering of electrolyte concentrations may be observed with severe
lipemia. With direct potentiometric methods using ion specific electrodes in which there is no
sample dilution, lipemic interference with measurement of electrolyte concentrations would
not be anticipated. If sodium and chloride are both decreased in an obviously lactescent
sample, another methodology should be used to confirm concentrations of these
electrolytes. Physiologic causes of decreased sodium and chloride include renal wasting or
water retention. Accumulation of free water and dilution of these electrolytes is a potential
mechanism in diabetics because of the ability of excessive amounts of glucose to draw water
into the circulation via osmosis. Renal losses should also be considered, and can be
quantified by performing urinary fractional excretions. Patients with hyponatremia should
have low urinary fractional excretion of sodium as the body attempts to conserve the
electrolyte. Normal to increased fractional excretion under these circumstances would be
abnormal and reflect either renal disease or hypoadrenocorticism (lack of aldosterone to
signal the need to conserve sodium in the kidney). Hypoadrenocorticism is a differential
diagnosis based on the electrolyte pattern, however the changes can be accounted for by
other mechanisms and an ACTH stimulation test is not likely to provide diagnostically useful
information. The change in chloride is proportional to the change in sodium and there are no
evident acid/base abnormalities (normal HCO3 and anion gap) at this time. Dietary deficiency
is rarely the cause of low sodium and chloride in small animal patients on commercial diets.


Hyperkalemia: In this case, a relative or absolute lack of insulin could result in high serum
potassium and may explain the mild hyperkalemia seen here. Potassium may accumulate if
urine cannot be eliminated from the body, but this explanation is not compatible with the
clinical history.


Increased ALP with normal GGT: ALP may increase with cholestasis, however, in the dog,
there are numerous extrahepatic causes for elevated ALP (Chapter 2). In this case, the
presence of diabetes mellitus is likely to account for some of the liver enzyme elevations,
although concurrent endocrinopathies such as hyperadrenocorticism cannot be ruled out.


Increased ALT and AST: Hepatocellular enzymes also may increase with endocrinopathies
such as diabetes mellitus or hyperadrenocorticism. Primary liver pathology cannot be ruled
out because changes in these enzymes are not specific for the cause.


Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia: Post-prandial effects should be
considered, however endocrinopathies such as diabetes are common causes of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia in small animal patients. Hyperadrenocorticism and
hypothyroidism are also associated with altered lipid metabolism. Liver and pancreatic
disease can elevate these values, and hepatic pathology cannot be completely excluded in
this case. Because Gerhardt is a schnauzer, the possibility of a pre-existing primary idiopathic
hyperlipidemia should be considered despite its relatively rare occurrence. Examination of
any “normal” blood work that may have been performed in the past as part of a routine
health screen or prior to elective surgery should be reviewed for evidence of idiopathic
hyperlipidemia. Previous episodes of pancreatitis secondary to hyperlipidemia could
predispose Gerhardt to the development of diabetes mellitus. Because of the complex
relationships between pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, it may be difficult
to determine which processes are primary and which are secondary.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Gerhardt was treated with antibiotics for the nasal discharge. As noted above, his blood
glucose curve was acceptable, however he continued to have significant hyperlipidemia,
indicating that a fructosamine level should be considered to verify adequate glycemic
control. Gerhardt’s blood pressure was elevated. Hypertension is associated with diabetes
mellitus in people and dogs (Struble), but is not documented in diabetic cats (Sennello). Two
months after this presentation, Gerhardt presented for bilateral epistaxis. The owners
declined to have this investigated and elected to have Gerhardt euthanized. At necropsy,
Gerhardt had good body condition, but the sinuses were cavitated and filled with friable
necrotic tissue that contained numerous branched septate hyphae compatible with
Aspergillus. The heart showed evidence of atherosclerosis, which is rare in dogs but may be
more common in miniature schnauzers (Liu). Atherosclerosis can be associated with
hypothyroidism and chronic elevations in plasma lipids. Hypertension may accelerate the
development of lesions. Clinical signs associated with atherosclerosis in dogs are rare. There
were no significant hepatic lesions despite the enzyme elevations, suggesting that the
elevations were secondary to the diabetes mellitus. Histologic examination of the kidneys
revealed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with mild interstitial fibrosis despite the
absence of azotemia at the time of euthanasia.


This and several other cases in this chapter underscore the impact of metabolic
derangements unrelated to renal disease on serum BUN and creatinine. Gerhardt had
decreases in BUN likely related to osmotic diuresis and polyuria. Decreased BUN and
creatinine were noted in Case 3, Marsali, who presented for starvation related to neglect.
Pugsley, Case 12, presented with decreased BUN and creatinine related to a portosystemic
shunt, while Riff Raff, Case 8, had elevated BUN because of a septic process.
