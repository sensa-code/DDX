Hooligan’s case illustrates how multiple concurrent diseases and laboratory abnormalities can
complicate interpretation of diagnostic tests. In some cases, the correct interpretation of
some laboratory data can only be certain after treatment has begun. For example, the
degree of renal versus prerenal azotemia cannot be determined until the patient is
appropriately hydrated. Furthermore, the true renal concentrating ability may not be clear
until glucosuria and the resultant osmotic diuresis is corrected. Although the previous two
cases of diabetes mellitus were not azotemic (Marion-Case 18 and Amaryllis-Case 19),
patients with diabetes mellitus can present with prerenal azotemia and impaired urinary
concentrating ability due to osmotic diuresis in the absence of irreversible renal failure.


As noted above, primary liver disease is less likely to be the cause of liver enzyme elevations
than the diabetes. Liver disease cannot be ruled out, however invasive procedures such as
liver biopsy are not recommended until other extrahepatic causes of liver enzyme elevations
are assessed. Evaluation of the patient for hyperthyroidism is indicated. Similarly, while
pancreatic disease cannot be ruled out as a cause for clinical signs or a possible contributing
factor to the liver enzyme elevations, amylase is a poor test for pancreatitis in the cat. A
trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) test could be done if pancreatitis remains a concern, but
results need to be interpreted with caution in a patient with renal disease or dehydration as
the results of this test may also be affected by a low glomerular filtration rate. Serum
pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (cPLI) may also be useful in the diagnosis of feline
pancreatitis (Forman).

GI Case 21 – Level 3
Kabob is a 9-year-old spayed female miniature poodle. She had been seen one year ago by
her referring veterinarian for lethargy and anorexia. Blood work at that time showed elevated
liver enzymes with hypoglycemia and hypoalbuminemia. Kabob was treated with antibiotics
and showed improvement in clinical signs and liver enzyme values, however the serum
biochemistry data did not completely normalize. She did well at home until just prior to this
presentation, at which time she was lethargic, anorexic, and vomiting. On physical
examination, Kabob is icteric, has cranial organomegaly, and has tacky mucous membranes.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: Kabob has an inflammatory leukogram with marked neutrophilic leukocytosis
with a left shift, monocytosis and toxic change in the neutrophils.


Erythrogram: Kabob has a normocytic, normochromic anemia. This anemia appears nonregenerative, and there is inadequate response by the bone marrow. Chronic disease or
inflammation usually produces a mild non-regenerative anemia as a result of suppression of
red blood cell production. In this case, it may not completely explain an anemia of this
severity. The red blood cell breakdown products in the bone marrow could suggest increased
destruction or apoptosis of red blood cell precursors in the marrow, which may be immunemediated and non-specifically related to the underlying illness. There is no evidence of a
neoplastic process in the bone marrow that could suppress erythropoiesis.


Platelets: Because of the megakaryocytic hyperplasia in the marrow, the thrombocytopenia is
interpreted to be due to increased peripheral consumption rather than impaired production.
Hemorrhage can cause thrombocytopenia and should be considered with anemia and panhypoproteinemia, however the degree of thrombocytopenia resulting from hemorrhage is
generally mild to moderate. The owners should be questioned carefully to determine if there
is any evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Immune-mediated mechanisms appear likely due
to the severity of the thrombocytopenia, which is in the range where there is a risk of
spontaneous hemorrhage. Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia can occur secondary to
neoplasia, however none has been found at this time. Prolonged coagulation times and
increased fibrinogen degradation products combined with the thrombocytopenia suggest the


development of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Vaccination can be associated with a
mild to moderate but transient thrombocytopenia, as can viral infections. A careful history
should be taken on all thrombocytopenic patients to rule out exposure to drugs or toxins.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: Any single low blood glucose measurement should be confirmed with a
repeat sample because of the possibility of in vitro consumption of glucose by cells in unspun
samples. This is especially important in samples with high leukocyte counts as observed in
this patient. CBC data are compatible with a severe inflammatory process, and low blood
glucose levels may be observed in septic patients. Failure of hepatic gluconeogenesis and
hypoglycemia can result from severely impaired liver function. Further support for this is
concurrent hypoalbuminemia, low BUN, hyperbilirubinemia and prolonged coagulation times.
None of these tests are sensitive or specific for decreased liver function. Another potential
cause for hypoglycemia is neoplasia. Insulinoma (See Russell-Case 6) and large intra-cavitary
masses that produce abnormal insulin-like growth factors (See Kippy-Case 5) can stimulate
glucose uptake by cells. Imaging studies and biopsy may be required to establish a diagnosis
of neoplasia and should be considered if liver function tests are normal, although they are
indicated as part of further work-up of the liver disease regardless. Both hypoalbuminemia
and hypoglycemia can be explained by prolonged starvation, however this is unusual and
occurs predominantly in cases with poor body condition scores.


Low BUN and Creatinine: Overhydration can dilute blood urea nitrogen, and polyuria will
result in increased urinary losses of BUN. The very low urine specific gravity is compatible
with polyuria. It is difficult in this case to assess hydration status using laboratory data
because the disease processes are likely to have confounding effects on hematocrit and total
protein. Despite the dilute urine, the tacky mucous membranes imply dehydration,
suggesting that overhydration is unlikely. Further information about any previous fluid
therapy would be helpful. Significantly decreased liver function will impair production of
BUN. Significant decrease in muscle mass is the major differential diagnosis for decreased
creatinine in the absence of retention of free water. As noted above in the discussion of
starvation in relation to hypoalbuminemia and hypoglycemia, the poor body condition should
be clinically obvious at the point that laboratory abnormalities can be attributed to
starvation. Similarly, negative protein balance can decrease production of blood urea
nitrogen.


Hypocalcemia: The hypocalcemia is associated with persistently low serum albumin,
therefore it is unlikely that there is truly a low ionized calcium. If there were concurrent
abnormalities of phosphorus or any clinical signs compatible with hypocalcemia, then ionized
calcium measurement would be recommended.


Minimal hypomagnesemia: This abnormality is commonly noted in critically ill patients and in
this case may be attributable to either decreased intake or increased renal losses. Because
calcium regulation and many other biochemical processes require magnesium as a critical
cofactor, supplementation is recommended. Like calcium, ionized magnesium is the physiologically significant value.


Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia: The disproportionately low albumin compared to
globulin could be compatible with decreased hepatic production of albumin or selective loss
of albumin via the glomerulus. Many other sources of increased protein loss such as gastrointestinal tract, skin, and third space encompass losses of both albumin and globulins. As
noted above, decreased hepatic production of albumin may occur secondary to decreased
intake/starvation, poor liver function in general, or as part of the acute phase response since


albumin is a negative acute phase reactant. The negative urinary protein data should be
interpreted in the context of the low specific gravity and may not rule out renal protein loss.
A urinary protein:creatinine ratio is a more accurate way to assess proteinuria in these cases.
At this point, decreased liver function appears to be the most likely cause for low serum
albumin, however increased demands on the protein pool such as fever or surgery could
further deplete albumin.


Hypokalemia: Kabob is predisposed to the development of hypokalemia because of
anorexia and poor dietary intake of potassium. Physiologically significant hypokalemia is most
likely to develop in concert with increased losses associated with gastrointestinal losses, renal
losses associated with polyuria, or third space losses, all of which are possible here.
Iatrogenic hypokalemia can develop if low potassium fluids are given in significant quantities.


Mildly decreased anion gap: This mild abnormality is caused by low albumin. Under normal
circumstances, most of the unmeasured anions are negatively charged plasma proteins.


Hyperbilirubinemia: Hemolysis, sepsis, cholestasis, and decreased liver function are all
possible causes for the hyperbilirubinemia in this case, and all could potentially contribute to
varying degrees. While the anemia may suggest hemolysis as a contributor to the bilirubin
levels, hemolytic anemias are typically regenerative and are coupled with red blood cell
morphologic changes. The inflammatory leukogram and hypoglycemia could be associated
with sepsis, which can impair hepatocellular uptake of bile. The elevated ALP and GGT
suggest cholestasis. The potential for decreased liver function has been discussed above, and
further testing is required to evaluate this component.


Elevated ALP and GGT: Although extrahepatic causes of enzyme elevation can be
important, the concurrent hyperbilirubinemia and hyperbilirubinuria support the presence of
a cholestatic process. Although not technically out of range, the cholesterol values seem
somewhat low for a patient with cholestatic liver disease; this may be another sign of
decreased liver function.


Elevated ALT and AST: Elevations in these enzymes support hepatocellular damage. Because
the elevations in the hepatocellular enzymes are milder than those noted in the cholestatic
enzymes, hepatocellular damage may be occurring secondary to a primary cholestatic process.


Increased amylase: Increased serum amylase is often used as an indicator of pancreatic disease,
however intestinal disease, liver disease, and decreased glomerular filtration rate can all increase
serum amylase. Because Kabob’s elevation is amylase in mild and is later shown to be transient,
a primary pancreatic process appears less likely than the other causes for elevations in this
enzyme.


Urinalysis: Despite some clinical evidence for dehydration, the urine specific gravity is dilute.
Renal failure appears to be unlikely in the absence of azotemia. Other considerations include
medullary washout, or decreased liver function. Given the mild electrolyte changes in the
context of the other data, liver failure seems likely. Causes for polyuria and dilute urine in
liver failure include overstimulation of adrenocorticotropic hormone and chronic hypercortisolism and impaired osmotic stimulation of antidiuretic hormone release. In some dogs,
nausea may stimulate polydipsia, and low BUN may impair the osmotic concentrating
gradient in the kidney (Rothuizen).


Hyperbilirubinuria is expected to reflect renal excretion of bilirubin from the blood. Heme
and erythrocytes may be an artifact associated with blood contamination of the sample with
subsequent hemolysis of erythrocytes in the dilute urine. The presence of bacteria indicates
the need for a bacterial culture, especially with other clinical and laboratory indicators of
inflammation and potential sepsis.


Bone marrow aspirate: Inflammation is resulting in the myeloid hyperplasia. Megakaryocytic
hyperplasia is in response to the peripheral destruction of platelets. The response to anemia
was discussed previously.


Coagulation profile: Prolonged PT and APTT can be explained by markedly impaired liver
function due to low levels of production of coagulation factors. Elevated fibrinogen degradation
products may be seen with liver failure since the liver is responsible for their clearance. The
thrombocytopenia is not expected to occur with uncomplicated poor liver function and in
combination with the other changes suggest disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A
septic process could trigger DIC. Poor baseline liver function could predispose Kabob to DIC
because of the central role of the liver in the regulation of coagulation.
