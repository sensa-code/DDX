###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Pleural effusion was documented radiographically, and Diamond experienced respiratory
arrest during bilateral chest tube placement. She was successfully resuscitated and placed on
a ventilator overnight. She responded to antibiotic treatment for the septic process in her
thoracic cavity and was eventually weaned from the ventilator.


Diamond’s data may be compared with June (Chapter 4, Case 11), who also had pyothorax.
Both cats had hyponatremia and hypochloridemia, but June was able to maintain her serum
potassium level while Diamond was hypokalemic. Both experienced significant protein losses
along with electrolyte depletion associated with the effusions. Both cats also had mild hyperbilirubinemia and liver enzyme elevations due to sepsis, but June had mild stress or early
endotoxin associated hyperglycemia while Diamond had hypoglycemia attributable to sepsis.


Case 24 – Level 3
“Caviar” is a 5-month-old female Bichon Frise presenting with a history of vomiting, diarrhea,
and poor appetite since she was adopted 3 months ago. On physical examination, Caviar is
weak and dull and very thin. She is tachycardic and has weak pulses. During the examination,
she has bloody diarrhea.

###### **Intepretation**

CBC: Caviar has a neutrophilic leukocytosis with a very mild left shift and a reactive
lymphocytosis compatible with inflammation and antigenic stimulation. The monocytopenia has
no clinical implication. The significance of small numbers of nucleated erythrocytes in a young
animal is questionable, however endothelial damage secondary to inflammation or sepsis is a
possible cause for these cells to be present in the circulation. Nucleated red blood cells may
also appear during a regenerative response to anemia. Caviar has a normocytic hypochromic
anemia which is difficult to classify at this time. The hypochromasia could reflect some attempt
at regeneration. A reticulocyte count is needed to assess a regenerative response.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: Once processing errors have been ruled out, physiologic causes of
hypoglycemia may be considered. The inflammatory leukogram and poor clinical condition at
presentation are compatible with sepsis. Impaired liver function associated with a congenital
portovascular anomaly is possible and supported by other laboratory indicators indicative of
poor hepatic function, including low BUN, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, decreased
serum cholesterol and prolonged coagulation times. Evaluation of liver function by
measurement of serum bile acids or blood ammonia is strongly recommended. The young
age of the patient makes paraneoplastic hypoglycemia unlikely. Although Caviar clearly has
poor body condition and nutritional deficits, this is rarely a cause of hypoglycemia by itself
(See Belinda, Chapter 4, Case 1; Marsali, Chapter 5, Case 3; Diva, Chapter 6, Case 16).


Decreased BUN and creatinine: Decreased BUN may be related to potentially compromised
liver function. Low creatinine is attributed to poor body condition and low muscle mass.


Hypocalcemia with normal phosphorus: Low total serum calcium is probably caused by the
low serum albumin. The chronic history of diarrhea suggests the possibility of malabsorption
as a cause hypocalcemia (See Red Molly, Chapter 4, Case 4).


Panhypoproteinemia: Most patients with panhypoproteinemia are experiencing increased
nonselective losses of protein. In this case, gastrointestinal losses seem the most likely route
with the history of chronic diarrhea as well as gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Hemorrhage may
be secondary to defects in hemostasis as indicated by the prolonged coagulation times.
Given the chronicity of the problem, other causes of diarrhea and protein losing enteropathy
need to be evaluated in this patient. Nutritional factors may further compromise Caviar’s
ability to compensate for ongoing losses and to maintain serum protein levels. Compounding
these factors is the the potential for decreased liver function to impair albumin production.


Globulin levels in young animals may be slightly lower than aged animals because they have
been exposed to fewer antigens.


Hyponatremia with low normal chloride: Gastrointestinal losses of electrolytes are
suspected. Hemorrhage may contribute to the hyponatremia by triggering mechanisms
resulting in retention of free water by the kidney in response to hypovolemia and dilutional
effects. The chloride is relatively high compared with sodium, however the serum
bicarbonate remains within the reference interval. This is compatible with a mixed acid/base
disorder, and blood gas analysis should be considered.


Hyperkalemia: Assuming that significant hemolysis or release from damaged tissues is ruled
out, decreased urinary excretion of potassium should be evaluated. This commonly occurs if
urine cannot be eliminated from the body such as with oliguric/anuric renal failure, urinary
tract obstruction, or ruptured urinary bladder. Although a urinalysis is not currently available,
Caviar is producing urine and does not have a clinical history compatible with these
problems. The electrolyte abnormalities and history of gastrointestinal signs could also be
consistent with hypoadrenocorticism, however Caviar would be a very young dog to present
with this condition. Alternatively, some dogs with primary gastrointeintal disorders may
develop these electrolyte abnormalities, resembling hypoadrenocorticism. This occurs
because of diarrhea-induced losses of water, sodium and chloride result in volume
contraction and subsequent low renal tubular flow rate and potassium retension. Because
whipworm infection has been documented in dogs with this pseudohypoadrenocorticism
syndrome, a fecal floatation is warranted.


Decreased anion gap: This abnormality may be explained by the marked hypoproteinemia.
Proteins such as albumin are important unmeasured anions.


Hyperbilirubinemia: Both sepsis and decreased liver function seem likely causes for the mild
hyperbilirubinemia. The slight elevation in ALP and normal GGT make significant cholestasis less
likely. Because Caviar is anemic, the blood film should be evaluated for evidence of hemolysis.


Increased ALP: The cause of this mild abnormality may be difficult to determine in a dog
with a complex clinical presentation. Extra-hepatic causes of increased ALP include bone
growth in young dogs and the effects of medications and hormones. Mild cholestasis could
result from swelling secondary to hepatocellular damage. Liver enzyme elevations also occur
in association with intestinal damage because of increased exposure to bacteria and toxins
from the damaged gut.


Increased ALT and AST: Elevations in these enzymes reflect hepatocellular damage. Some
degree of hepatocellular hypoxia/hypoperfusion is likely given the anemia and potential for
sepsis. Primary liver disease should also be considered since other laboratory abnormalities
are consistent with decreased liver function.


Hypocholesterolemia: This abnormality is consistent with either decreased liver function or
intestinal loss secondary to protein losing enteropathy.


Coagulation profile: Prolongation of coagulation times may occur with decreased liver
function due to failure to produce coagulation factors. This may be compounded by impaired
gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin K, resulting in vitamin K deficiency and production of
inactive coagulation factors.


###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Caviar was treated with antibiotics, intravenous fluids, plasma, and dextrose. Her condition
seemed to improve. Further diagnostic work-up included a negative parvovirus test and fecal
floatation. Postprandial serum bile acids were 221 µmol/L (reference interval = 0-25),
confirming poor liver function. A large extrahepatic vascular shunt was demonstrated by
abdominal ultrasound, however there was concern about the possibility of concurrent
intestinal disease, including lymphangiectasia or infectious enteritis. Caviar stabilized with
medical therapy and underwent surgical correction of the shunt. She began to eat and
maintain a normal glucose level after surgery, however a few days after discharge, she
developed ascites. Another surgery was performed to attempt to reduce the constriction of
the shunt, but it was not possible to remove or enlarge the constrictor. She responded to
symptomatic therapy and was discharged to the care of the referring veterinarian.


In Caviar’s case, the combination of increased gastrointestinal losses of electrolytes with poor
perfusion and inadequate renal excretion of potassium produced electrolyte abnormalities that
could be associated with hypoadrenocorticism (Case 13), uroabdomen (Case 21), and other
causes of third space losses such as effusion (Case 1). In previous cases of electrolyte
depletion associated with hypoglycemia, the decreased blood glucose has been due to sepsis
(Pat, Chapter 7, Case 22), but Caviar’s hypoglycemia is due to inadequate liver function.

Urine specific gravity: 1.035

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Albus has leucopenia characterized by marked neutropenia and mild toxic change
suggestive for acute inflammation or endotoxemia, likely related to intestinal disease.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Diabetes mellitus is rare in horses, and the hyperglycemia in this case is
related to stress or excitement.


Azotemia: The urine specific gravity suggests that the azotemia is of pre-renal origin.


Hyperphosphatemia: The pre-renal decrease in glomerular filtration rate is leading to
accumulation of phosphorus.


Hypocalcemia: The mild hypocalcemia is probably related to the presence of gastrointestinal
disease (see Faith, Chapter 5, Case 19).


Hypoproteinemia with hypoglobulinemia: Hypoglobulinemia is most often associated with
concurrent hypoalbuminemia and reflects non-selective protein losses into the gut, third
space, through the skin, or with hemorrhage. In this case, the albumin remains within the
reference intervals. Isolated hypoglobulinemia can reflect failure of passive transfer in
neonatal animals, but globulins remain somewhat low until antigenic exposure of initially
naïve animals increases immunoglobulin production over time. Albus is likely to have had
serum globulin levels at the lower end of the reference interval prior to his illness as an agerelated phenomenon. Rarely, congenital immunodeficiency syndromes such as combined
immunodeficiency syndrome of Arabian foals can result in failure of globulin production.


Mild hyponatremia with disproportionately greater hypochloridemia: Gastrointestinal
losses of sodium and chloride are contributing to these abnormalities. Decreases in chloride
that are disproportionate to changes in sodium are often associated with alkalemia. When a
disproportionate hypochloremia is associated with decreases in HCO3, as in this case, a
mixed acid/base disorder is suspected. In Albus, poor perfusion and lactic acidosis may lead
to increased amounts of lactate in the urine. Because lactate cannot be resorbed by the renal
tubules, sodium excretion in the urine is increased to maintain electrical neutrality.
Consequently, chloride resorption in the proximal and collecting tubules does not occur
because it depends on the electrochemical gradient established by prior resorption of
sodium, which is failing to occur.


Hyperkalemia: Accumulation of potassium in the serum can occur when glomerular filtration
rate drops sufficiently to prevent elimination of potassium in the urine. Additionally, inorganic
acidosis can cause a transcellular shift of potassium outside of cells. Other potential causes


for hyperkalemia that are unlikely in this particular patient based on the clinical history and
laboratory work would include massive tissue necrosis or rhabdomyolysis, hypoaldosteronism,
and effects of drugs such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or trimethoprim-sulfa
antibiotics. Rhabdomyolysis and tissue necrosis are unlikely given the very mild increases in
enzymes such as CK.


High anion gap acidosis: The high anion gap is the result of accumulation of unmeasured
anions. Possibilties for Albus include uremic acids, and lactic acidosis secondary to
dehydration and poor perfusion.


Increased ALP and LDH: Liver enzymes may increase secondary to intestinal disease due to
a variety of mechanisms. These may include hepatocellular injury from increased exposure to
bacteria, endotoxin, or inflammatory mediators. Hepatocellular hypoxia may result from
systemic inflammation and circulatory imbalances. Ascending biliary infection or regurgitation
of intestinal contents into the common bile duct associated with increased luminal pressure
can result in cholestasis. In one study, histopathologic evaluation of the liver from five horses
with proximal enteritis all had liver lesions that were attributed to the intestinal disease,
supporting the interpretation that liver enzyme elevations can occur secondary to enteritis
(Davis). While hepatocellular injury is the most likely cause for the increased serum LDH, this
enzyme is not liver specific and may also originate from muscle tissue. ALP may also be high
in young animals due to bone growth.
