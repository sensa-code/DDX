Hyperphosphatemia: Decreased glomerular filtration rate is a common cause of hyperphosphatemia and is consistent with pre-renal azotemia in a patient that is dehydrated or has
impaired cardiac function. Tissue necrosis may increase serum phosphorus. However, there is
little evidence to support this mechanism without a CK, only a mildly increased AST, and the
potassium within reference intervals. Because the calcium is also low, hypoparathyroidism
also may be considered. The most likely cause of the hypocalcemia is decreased protein
bound calcium secondary to the hypoalbuminemia.


Hypoalbuminemia and normal globulin: Isolated hypoalbuminemia may be attributable to
decreased production. Liver failure is possible given the hypoglycemia and prolonged
coagulation times. However, other substances produced by the liver such as urea and
cholesterol are not decreased. Specific tests of liver function such as serum bile acids or
blood ammonia could be performed as more sensitive and specific indicators of liver
function. Alternatively, the liver may decrease production of albumin in response to
inflammation, because this protein is a negative acute phase reactant. This seems likely in the
context of the neutrophilia and septic pericardial effusion. Decreased production due to
starvation is unlikely in a patient with adequate body condition. Albumin also may be
selectively lost via the glomerulus, and could be evaluated by urinalysis. Nonspecific protein
losses into third space including the pericardial sac usually result in decreases in both albumin
and globulins. Repeated drainage of the pericardial effusion can contribute to the hypoalbuminemia. Loss of globulins by this route may be countered by increased production with
inflammation, resulting in globulin values that fall within the reference interval. Lastly, dilution
of albumin may occur in fluid loading states such as congestive heart failure, which could be
an issue here because of the pericardial effusion.


Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Similar to protein, serum levels of sodium and chloride
reflect the balance of intake, losses, and dilution. Routes of electrolyte losses are similar to
protein and include the kidney, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and third space. In Pat’s case, third
space loss into the pericardial cavity, especially with repeated drainage, could deplete
electrolytes. Electrolyte loss via the kidneys may be evaluated by measuring urinary fractional
excretions, however these are rarely performed in routine practice. The absence of significant
signs of gastrointestinal disease makes this route unlikely. Hemodilution or hemoconcentration also may alter serum electrolyte concentrations if free water changes are disproportionate to gains or losses of electrolytes. In the case of congestive heart failure, poor
perfusion pressures trigger antidiuretic hormone release, which will encourage increased
water intake and free water retention, effectively diluting sodium and chloride. Most
domestic animals on commercial diets will not have dietary deficiency or excess of sodium
and chloride.


Hyperbilirubinemia: The septic process described above may be interfering with
hepatocellular uptake of bile, resulting in a mild hyperbilirubinemia. Increases in ALP, ALT,
and AST support the potential for hepatobiliary disease and cholestasis, which could cause
increased bilirubin, although the cholestatic enzyme GGT is not elevated. Hemolysis as a
cause of the mild increase in serum bilirubin is unlikely give the normal PCV. If the hyperbilirubinemia persists after successful treatment of the infectious process, further


investigation of the potential for liver disease should be considered.


Increased ALP with normal GGT: Extrahepatic causes of liver enzyme elevations should
always be considered in addition to the potential for hepatobiliary disease. Both sepsis and
cardiovascular disease have the potential to elevate serum liver enzyme activities in the
absence of primary liver pathology. A thorough drug history should be taken to rule out
effects of medications, and concurrent endocrinopathies need to be considered for their
potential to impact liver enzymes.


Increased ALT and AST: ALT is relatively liver specific in small animal species and generally
reflects hepatocellular damage. AST is present in the liver, but is less specific and will
increase with damage to extrahepatic tissues such as muscle. Sepsis and poor perfusion are
expected to cause hepatocellular damage, but may injure other tissues as well.


Coagulation profile: Both the PT and APTT are prolonged, indicating a defect of secondary
hemostasis. Both liver disease and sepsis may impair hemostasis. Disseminated intravascular
coagulation is not yet occurring based on the normal platelet numbers and fibrin
degradation products.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Based on the initial data, Pat was treated with fluids and antibiotics. Echocardiography
revealed a large volume of fluid still present within the pericardial sac, right atrial collapse,
and a small left ventricle with moderate function. Because of the persistent pericardial
effusion, a multi-hole catheter was placed for continuous drainage. Later, Pat had surgery to
remove a section of the pericardium. Histology revealed severe fibrinopurulent bacterial
pericarditis. During surgery, a chest tube was placed to continue drainage of purulent
material. Over the five days following surgery, Pat became progressively more bright and
alert. Drainage collected from the chest tubes showed diminishing inflammation, and tubes
were removed. Pat was discharged on long-term combination antibiotic therapy.


Like Snow (Case 7) and Isis (Case 11) in this chapter, poor perfusion due to cardiovascular
compromise could lead to free water retention and dilution of Pat’s serum electrolytes. In
Pat’s case, loss of electrolytes into the pericardial effusion would also potentiate
hyponatremia and hypochloremia, while Snow had increased renal loss of electrolytes
associated with the use of diuretics for her heart disease. Isis experienced cutaneous loss of
electrolytes through her degloving wound. Pat’s serum potassium levels are currently within
the reference interval. However, serum potassium levels do not accurately reflect total body
potassium stores, which may be low due to the effusion, anorexia or vomiting. Poor renal
perfusion associated with septic shock may promote higher serum potassium. Serum
potassium values may fluctuate rapidly in response to therapy or changes in Pat’s medical
condition. Unlike Snow, Isis and Pat may have experienced nonselective protein losses as
well. Isis was able to maintain serum protein levels while Pat developed hypoproteinemia.
Serum protein levels may also be affected by water retention and dilution.


Case 23 – Level 3
“Diamond” is a 2.5-year-old spayed female domestic short haired, indoor/outdoor cat that
presented with a history of lethargy, depression, and decreased appetite for three days. On
physical examination, Diamond is recumbent, pale and hypothermic, and no menace or blink
response can be elicited. She has dyspnea and bradycardia. On auscultation, heart sounds
are muffled, and foul smelling brown fluid is obtained via thoracocentesis. Her body
condition score is low.

Thoracic Fluid Analysis
Appearance: brown and opaque
Total protein: 3.5 g/dl
Total nucleated cells: 240,000/µl


Description: Direct smears contain large numbers of cells, however
cells are in very poor condition. The majority of cells that can be
identified are extremely degenerate neutrophils that contain numerous
bacteria of mixed morphology. Many large foamy macrophages are
also present. Bacteria also occur in large extracellular mats. Both Gram
positive and negative organisms are present, including small
coccobacilli and some long, thin rods that chain.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: There is a marked mature neutrophilic leukocytosis with toxic change compatible with
inflammation, the source of which is the thoracic cavity. Diamond also has a normocytic,
normochromic anemia that is interpreted to be non-regenerative. A reticulocyte count is
needed to confirm this conclusion. Anemia of chronic disease is a likely contributor, however
given the relatively low protein, acute hemorrhage should also be considered. Infectious
causes of anemia such as panleukopenia (unlikely here with the leukocytosis) and FeLV should
always be ruled out, especially in young cats. The concurrent moderate thrombocytopenia
also suggests that a bone marrow disorder should be considered, however decreased
platelets may be associated with increased consumption secondary to hemorrhage or
inflammatory disease rather than failure of production. Patients with a septic focus may
develop disseminated intravascular coagulation, which can cause moderate thrombocytopenia due to increased consumption.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: This increase may be due to the nonspecific effects of illness or stress. Acute
endotoxemia may be associated with hyperglycemia, although some septic patients
eventually develop hypoglycemia.


Decreased BUN and creatinine: These analytes may be low due to poor body condition or
low protein diet. They are not likely to be clinically significant, other than to rule out
azotemia at this point.


Hypocalcemia: The most likely cause for the hypocalcemia is the decrease in albumin.
Because the cat is profoundly weak, an ionized calcium should be measured to determine if
Diamond would benefit from supplementation.


Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia and borderline-low globulins: Dilution, decreased
production, and increased losses are the basic mechanisms for low serum protein values. No
specific evaluation of hydration status was mentioned in the clinical history, however with the
history of lethargy and anorexia, Diamond is more likely to be dehydrated than overhydrated.
Diamond’s poor body condition is potentially compatible with low protein production
associated with malnutrition, however the decrease in protein associated with poor intake is
usually milder than the seen here. Because there is evidence of inflammation, albumin
production may be low because it is an acute phase reactant. Poor liver function also may
result in low albumin production, however this seems less likely in the context of the clinical
history. Increased losses into the septic effusion in the thorax is a major contributor to the
hypoproteinemia and hypoalbuminemia in this case. Third space protein losses are generally


non-selective, resulting in loss of albumin and globulin. The globulin may remain within
reference intervals despite these losses because of increased production of immunoglobulins
and acute phase reactants in response to the inflammation. Other potential nonselective
sources of protein loss that are unlikely in this specific patient include gastrointestinal losses
and dermal losses. Selective loss of albumin via the glomerulus is not specifically evaluated
here because a urinalysis was not performed. Glomerular disease seems less likely because
the BUN and Cr are low, however the early phases of glomerular disease may not be always
be characterized by azotemia.


Hyponatremia with hypochloremia: The degree of hypochloremia is slightly greater than the
degree of hyponatremia (corrected chloride is 115 mEq/L). As discussed above in the protein
section, water accumulation is unlikely to account for the decreased sodium and chloride.
Decreased intake is also not likely to be important. Loss into the effusion is the most likely
cause for the abnormality, although other sources of increased loss cannot be ruled out. The
additional decrease in chloride that cannot be accounted for by the change in sodium is
attributed to the alkalemia.


Hypokalemia: The decrease in potassium is related to loss into the pleural effusion, however
decreased intake may also be a factor for this electrolyte. Acid/base abnormalities are often
cited as a cause for cellular translocation of potassium.


Alkalemia (increased HCO3): The alkalemia may be due to metabolic alkalosis or a
compensated respiratory acidosis. The presence of dyspnea and evidence of acid/base
abnormalities indicate the need for blood gas analysis to further characterize the process.


Low anion gap: The low anion gap is attributed to hypoalbuminemia.


Mild hyperbilirubinemia: Sepsis may interfere with hepatocellular uptake of bile, which can
cause slight increases in bilirubin. Because BUN and serum albumin are also low and
coagulation times are prolonged, decreased liver function should be considered, but is less
likely based on the clinical history. Significant cholestatic disease is unlikely because the ALP
and GGT are within reference intervals. The anemia suggests that hemolysis is possible.


Increased AST: This enzyme may originate from hepatocytes, muscle cells, or erythrocytes
and is a non-specific indicator of tissue damage. To clarify the tissue of origin, the AST should
be interpreted in the context of ALT and CK values. This elevation is mild and may not be
very diagnostically significant, however tissue damage may result from sepsis and poor
perfusion related to shock.


Abdominal fluid analysis: Septic suppurative inflammation


Coagulation: Thrombocytopenia with prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time could
be signs of a mixed hemostatic disorder such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
The presence of DIC is not corroborated by increases in FDPs. The degree of thrombocytopenia is not sufficiently severe to result in spontaneous bleeding as an isolated abnormality,
however in combination with a secondary hemostatic defect, abnormal bleeding is possible.
Diamond’s APTT is elevated, however the PT is within reference intervals. In general, liver
disease or vitamin K antagonists cause both the PT and the APTT to become prolonged.
Sometimes the PT is abnormal first because factor VII in the extrinsic pathway has the
shortest halflife, however occasionally the APTT will become prolonged first in liver disease.
Regardless, the coagulation status of this patient should be monitored.


###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Pleural effusion was documented radiographically, and Diamond experienced respiratory
arrest during bilateral chest tube placement. She was successfully resuscitated and placed on
a ventilator overnight. She responded to antibiotic treatment for the septic process in her
thoracic cavity and was eventually weaned from the ventilator.
