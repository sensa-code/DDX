###### **Interpretation**

CBC: There is a neutrophilia and lymphopenia present, suggestive for a corticosteroid
leukogram. However, inflammation cannot be ruled out, especially given the evidence of
urinary track infection seen in the urinalysis. The PCV is at the low end of the reference range
and should be monitored, especially if Tinker is dehydrated.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia and hyperphosphatemia: These changes are indicators of decreased glomerular
filtration rate. Because the patient is simultaneously isosthenuric, renal azotemia is likely,
although a pre-renal component also is probably superimposed given the history of vomiting
and diarrhea with increased urine output.


Mild hypercalcemia: While many small animal patients with renal failure present with
hypocalcemia, renal disease can be associated with variable changes in serum calcium.
Neoplasia is also a common cause of hypercalcemia in small animal patients.


Hypokalemia: Several factors in Tinker’s history could contribute to hypokalemia, including
decreased intake associated with anorexia, and increased losses due to vomiting and diarrhea
or polyuria. While serum electrolyte values may not reflect total body content in many cases,
potassium depletion itself can cause metabolic acidosis in cats and dogs (DiBartola) in addition
to hypokalemic nephropathy. Potassium depletion results in decreased tubular responsiveness
to antidiuretic hormone, leading to polyuria and polydipsia. Renal vasoconstriction depresses
glomerular filtration rate. In some cases, hypokalemic nephropathy is reversible with potassium
repletion, however in more chronic cases, tubulointerstitial nephritis develops with potentially
permanent renal damage.


Decreased HCO3 and increased anion gap: These data indicate acidemia with accumulation
of unmeasured anions. The most likely cause here is uremic acidosis, however if dehydration is
sufficient to cause poor tissue perfusion, lactic acidosis also may contribute to the acidemia and
organic acidosis. The clinical history could be compatible with diabetic ketoacidosis, but this is
not supported by the normal serum glucose and absence of glucosuria and ketonuria.
Exogenous acids such as ethylene glycol and other toxins can also increase the anion gap.


Increased ALP and AST, low ALT: Increased ALP with normal GGT can be compatible with
hepatic lipidosis in cats, which is possible given the history of weight loss, however most cats
with hepatic lipidosis are also hyperbilirubinemic (see Squid, Chapter 2, Case 11). Weight loss
with tachycardia in an older cat should prompt evaluation of the patient for hyperthyroidism.
Elevations in one or more of the liver enzymes is observed in over 90% of cases of hyperthyroidism in cats (Broussard). Liver enzyme elevations are reversible with control of thyroid
disease. Further work-up for primary liver disease is not recommended at this time because
extra-hepatic factors can account for enzyme changes. Liver enzyme levels below the reference
range (ALT) are not considered diagnostically significant and should not be over-interpreted.


Urinalysis: Bacteriuria, pyuria, and proteinuria indicate a urinary tract infection. Bacterial
culture and sensitivity should be considered. Pyelonephritis could cause renal failure, and
sepsis may also be associated with elevated liver enzymes (see Opie, Chapter 5, Case 13,
and Riff Raff, Chapter 5, Case 8) that are also present in this patient.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Thyroid hormone testing at a reference laboratory revealed hyperthyroidism (T4 = 7.5 µg/dl,
reference interval = 1.2-5.2). In-house ELISA assays for T4 are available, but may correlate
poorly with standard radio-immunoassay methods (Lurye). Tinker was also suspected to have
some degree of decreased renal function. Azotemia is commonly described in hyperthyroid
cats (Broussard), although the mechanisms are not clear. Some cats have concurrent renal
disease, while in other patients, the azotemia resolves with successful control of excess
thyroid hormone concentration. Increased protein catabolism and pre-renal factors related to
dehydration or associated cardiovascular disease also have been suggested as mechanisms
underlying the azotemia. Both hyperthyroidism and hypokalemia may have contributed to
the polyuria/polydipsia and decreased urine specific gravity seen in Tinker. Excess thyroid
hormone has been implicated in the development of dilute urine because of increased renal
medullary blood flow and inadequate medullary solute concentration. However, one study of
202 hyperthyroid cats documented low urine specific gravity in only 3% of cases (Broussard).


Identification of concurrent renal disease in hyperthyroid cats is important for several reasons.
The presence of non-thyroidal illness can lower thyroid hormone concentrations and interfere
with diagnosis of hyperthyroidism (Tomsa, McLoughlin). Potential mechanisms for this include
low binding of thyroid hormone to carrier proteins, low concentration or affinity of carrier
proteins, and impaired production of T4 (Panciera). In addition, there is some evidence that
treatment of hyperthyroidism in older cats may exacerbate underlying renal disease, possibly
because of reduction in GFR (DiBartola). Based on this data, it is recommended that
reversible medical treatment with methimazole be instituted prior to surgery or radioactive
iodide, in order that the effects of treatment on renal function can be determined prior to
permanent correction of hyperthyroidism.


Tinker was treated with antibiotics for a urinary tract infection and with methimazole, which
works by preventing incorporation of iodine into the tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin.
Follow-up blood work sixty days into therapy demonstrated resolution of hyperthyroidism
and a normal serum biochemical profile with the exception of a slight elevation in BUN.
Tinker was still isosthenuric, however her renal disease did not appear to have progressed
after control of the thyroid disease.


Ninety days into her treatment, Tinker presented for lethargy and the following laboratory
data were obtained:

Her CBC revealed pancytopenia. Both agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia are
occasionally reported as a side effect of treatment with methimazole, and they are most
often observed within the first ninety days of therapy (Behrend, Retsios). Eosinophilia,
leucopenia, and lymphocytosis have been described as potentially transient and do not
necessarily warrant drug withdrawal, however the thrombocytopenia is a more serious
consequence of treatment which requires discontinuation of therapy (Plumb). The cause of
the anemia is less clear, but could be related to the drug, although renal disease may also
contribute to the development of non-regenerative anemia due to impaired erythropoietin
production.


Tinker’s methimazole treatment was withdrawn, and her leukocyte and platelet counts
normalized in 2 weeks; there was improvement in her anemia, but it was persistent. During
this time, Tinker’s azotemia and liver enzyme elevations returned, and she became
hyperglycemic, which is common in untreated hyperthyroid cats. Because Tinker did not
tolerate methimazole and because her renal disease appeared stable after correction of her
hyperthyroidism, treatment with radioactive iodide was planned. Tinker’s case may be
compared with an uncomplicated case of feline hyperthyroidism (Rover, Chapter 2, Case 6),
in which no azotemia was present, nor was there any reaction to methimazole therapy.

Case 17 – Level 3
“Ziggy” is a 6-year-old castrated male domestic short haired cat presenting for acute onset
of vomiting, lethargy, and anorexia. The owners report that he was not grooming himself and
was vocalizing in the basement. Two years ago, Ziggy had a rear limb amputated due to
trauma. On physical examination, Ziggy appeared to be approximately 8% dehydrated.
Abdominal palpation revealed a small bladder and a small right kidney; the left kidney could
not be palpated. Mucous membranes were light pink and tacky. Ausculatation was normal.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Lymphopenia could be compatible with stress/corticosteroid effects. The PCV is in the
normal range, however this patient is significantly dehydrated. This PCV should be re-evaluated
once the patient is rehydrated to be sure that the dehydration in not masking a mild anemia.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia: Azotemia should be categorized as pre-renal, renal, or post-renal. The minimally
concentrated urine in the face of severe dehydration supports renal failure. There is no
evidence of post-renal disease such as fluid in the abdomen or a large, firm bladder. Because
the patient is significantly dehydrated, there is likely pre-renal azotemia in addition to renal
azotemia.


Hyperphosphatemia, hypermagnesemia, and normal calcium: The most likely cause of hyperphosphatemia and hypermagnesemia in this patient is decreased glomerular filtration rate,
regardless of whether the decreased glomerular filtration rate is due to pre-renal, renal, or postrenal causes. Small animal patients in renal failure may have high, normal, or low serum calcium
levels, and ionized calcium levels may not correlate with total calcium levels.


Increased total protein and albumin: Increases these analytes are most likely due to
dehydration.


Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Hyponatremia is rarely due to dietary deficiency of
sodium, and dilution because of free water is unlikely given clinical dehydration and hyperalbuminemia. Therefore, excessive loss of sodium is the probable cause for the hyponatremia.
While sodium may be lost via multiple routes including gastrointestinal, dermal, third space,
and renal, the clinical history is most compatible with renal losses. The diseased kidney may
be unable to adequately conserve sodium, and conversely, may be less able to excrete a
sodium load. Depending on intake and the relative rates of sodium and water loss, patients
with renal disease may have low, normal, or high serum sodium. Chloride often changes in
proportion to sodium, however in this case there is a disproportionate decrease in chloride
compared to sodium. This may be due to loss in vomitus. However the increased anion gap
and low normal HCO3 suggest the possibility of an acid/base disturbance, which could also
cause a disproportionate change in chloride.


Increased anion gap: Hyperproteinemia and dehydration can increase the anion gap, as can
the presence of increased organic acids in the blood. Ziggy may have increased uremic acids
because of his renal disease, and the marked dehydration may cause poor perfusion and
lactic acidosis. In general, chloride and HCO3 vary inversely. In this case the combination of
hypochloremia and borderline acidosis (low HCO3) suggest the possibility of a mixed
acid/base disorder. Vomiting of gastric contents could contribute to alkalemia. Alkalemia
itself can increase the anion gap because of loss of protons from plasma proteins resulting in
increased negative charge. Alkalemia can also stimulate phosphofructokinase leading to
increased production of lactic acid. Complete characterization of the acid/base status of this
patient requires blood gas analysis. Correction of the fluid deficits and treatment of the renal
disease should improve the acid/base status, regardless of the exact cause.


Hypercholesterolemia: Increases in cholesterol have been described in dogs with glomerular
nephritis and dogs with nephrotic syndrome. The mechanism for hypercholesterolemia in
nephrotic syndrome may be increased hepatic synthesis, and these patients often have an
inverse relationship between albumin and cholesterol (which is not present in this patient).
Abnormal lipoprotein lipase function related to inadequate amounts of its co-factor, heparan
sulfate, may also contribute to the hypercholesterolemia in nephrotic syndrome.


Increased Creatine kinase: This is evidence for muscle degeneration or necrosis. Muscle
breakdown associated with anorexia in cats can elevate serum CK (Fascetti). CK levels
normalized in anorexic cats once they were given adequate nutritional support.
