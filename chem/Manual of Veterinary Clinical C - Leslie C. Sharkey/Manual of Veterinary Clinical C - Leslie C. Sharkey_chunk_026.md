Increased BUN with normal serum creatinine: A concurrent urinalysis is required for
definitive interpretation of these values and is not available for this case. Nephropathy may
be induced by marked hemoglobinuria in some cases. BUN may also increase prior to
creatinine in early pre-renal azotemia because of the relatively greater influence of tubular
flow rates on the elimination of urea compared to creatinine. When the BUN is elevated but
the serum creatinine is within reference range, extra-renal factors need to be assessed. High
protein diet, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, fever, and tissue necrosis are other extra-renal
causes of increased BUN that should be ruled out in this case.


Mild hyperphosphatemia with normal calcium: The primary differentials for the mild hyperphosphatemia in this case are bone growth in a young dog and/or hemolysis. Bone bone
growth in young large breed dogs may elevate serum phosphorus as will lytic bone lesions,
and the patient should be evaluated for evidence of lameness or bone pain. Serum ALP
levels may be helpful in evaluating this possibility, however this data is unavailable due to
hemolysis of the sample. Decreased glomerular filtration rate is a common cause of hyperphosphatemia in adult dogs. Typically, the phosphorus will increase as a patient becomes
azotemic, and the high BUN is compatible with decreased glomerular filtration rate.
However, both the increased BUN and elevated phosphorus could result from tissue trauma
or necrosis. Hemolysis itself can increase serum phosphorus because of the high content of
phosphorus in erythrocytes. A similar mechanism involving release of phosphorus from
lymphoblasts or myeloblasts has been implicated in the hyperphosphatemia associated with
the tumor lysis syndrome, which would be highly unusual in an eight-month-old and is rarely
observed in adult dogs. Likewise, vitamin D toxicity and primary hypoparathyroidism are less
common causes of hyperphosphatemia and are unlikely in this patient because they are often
associated with hypocalcemia. Iatrogenic causes of hyperphosphatemia include
administration of intravenous phosphate or phosphate containing enemas, however this is
not compatible with the medical history. For a more complete discussion of abnormalities of
calcium and phosphorus see Chapter 6.


Hypoalbuminemia: Low serum albumin can result from either decreased production or
increased losses. Decreased hepatic production of albumin can occur as part of the acute
phase response, which is supported by the inflammatory leukogram. Low albumin production
secondary to liver failure is possible, however liver function appears adequate to support
gluconeogenesis and cholesterol production (remember that these are not good tests of liver


function). Prolonged coagulation times could also be attributed to impaired production of
coagulation factors secondary to decreased liver function. A liver function test such as serum
bile acids or serum ammonia could be performed. Decreased production may result from
starvation, which is not compatible with the clinical history. Increased losses of albumin
include third space, cutaneous, interstitial, gastrointestinal, and renal. Examination of the
patient for effusions and edema along with urine protein measurements could assist in ruling
out various sources of loss. Gastrointestinal losses of protein are more difficult to quantify,
however measurement of fecal alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor has been suggested as a
potential marker of protein loss into the gut. It is lost into the intestinal lumen with increased
mucosal permeability, however unlike many other proteins, alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor
resists degradation by gut proteases sufficiently that it may be measured in the feces.


Mild hypochloremia: Hypochloremia with normal serum sodium concentration suggests
vomiting of gastric contents, consistent with Jimbo’s history. Abnormalities of serum chloride
may occur with acid/base abnormalities, however the HCO3 is within reference range in this
profile. In general, the chloride varies inversely with HCO3, however this relationship is not
consistent in mixed acid/base abnormalities. Blood gas analysis is required to fully
characterize acid/base status, however this test is not necessary to proceed with treatment in
this case. Use of diuretics such a furosemide or thiazides can cause wasting, but again is not
present in Jimbo’s history.


Mild hypokalemia: Increased gastrointestinal losses and low intake because of anorexia
contribute to this electrolyte abnormality. Diuresis caused by diabetes mellitus can lead to
renal potassium wasting. Hyperglycemia with hyperinsulinemia can cause intracellular
translocation of potassium and may be a factor given Jimbo’s serum glucose. Similarly,
potassium will enter cells in response to alkalemia. Most potassium in the body is
intracellular, and low serum potassium does not always accurately reflect total body
potassium status. As with chloride, diuretic use can increase renal potassium loss.


Increased serum ALT and AST: Mild to moderate increases in these enzymes may occur with
hepatocellular damage, however AST is less tissue specific and muscle damage as well as
hemolysis can increase this value. There are several candidate causes for hepatocellular
damage in Jimbo’s case: hypoxia or hypoperfusion of hepatocytes secondary to anemia and
dehydration, local changes in perfusion or increased exposure to toxins or inflammatory
cytokines associated with intestinal disease (vomiting) or pancreatic disease (increased
amylase), and exposure to exogeneous toxins or drugs (including phenobarbital or corticosteroids). The potential for hepatocellular damage to occur secondary to cholestasis cannot
be evaluated because ALP, GGT and total bilirubin are invalidated by hemolysis. Extrahepatic
metabolic processes such as diabetes and hyperadrenocorticism also elevate serum liver
enzyme activities. As is often the case, the non-specific nature of liver enzyme activities in the
blood of dogs necessitates interpreting the data in the context of other clinical and
pathological data; cytology or biopsy may be required for specific diagnosis. Hemolysis may
cause release of these enzymes from erythrocytes. Please see Chapter 2 for a more
comprehensive discussion of liver enzyme interpretation.


Mild hyperamylasemia with normal lipase: Both of these enzymes are considered to be
markers of pancreatic damage, however they are not produced exclusively by that organ. The
activities of both enzymes may increase in the blood up to two to four times the upper limit
of the reference interval with decreased glomerular filtration rate, which may be a factor
here, given the elevated BUN and phosphorus. Vomiting and dehydration could be a cause
for pre-renal impairment of glomerular filtration rate, or could be compatible with other
pancreatic or intestinal diseases that can elevate serum amylase. Although in theory, changes


in amylase and lipase should occur simultaneously in response to pancreatic damage, the
reality is that in clinical patients there is often discordance between them. Some authors
indicate that lipase is a superior test for pancreatitis (Brobst), however some dogs with
confirmed pancreatitis fail to show elevations in serum lipase (Strombeck). Based on a variety
of recent studies, various authors have advocated the measurement of canine trypsin-like
immunoreactivity, canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (Steiner), and plasma
trypsinogen activation peptide concentration (Mansfield) for the diagnosis of pancreatitis in
dogs with elevated pancreatic enzymes and clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease. None of
these tests appears to have ideal sensitivity and specificity under all conditions, and the
diagnosis of pancreatitis continues to rely on identifying a convincing combination of clinical
signs, laboratory abnormalities, and imaging data.


Coagulation data: Prolonged PT and APTT suggest abnormalities of secondary hemostasis
involving both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways and/or the common pathway. In combination
with evidence of increased fibrinolysis (FDP >20 µg/ml), a mixed hemostatic disorder such as
disseminated intravascular coagulation is possible despite the normal platelet count. Decreased
liver function could also impair production of clotting factors and slow elimination of fibrin
degradation products, however no specific tests of liver function are available at this time.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Shortly after admission, Jimbo experienced cardiopulmonary arrest. He was resuscitated and
briefly maintained on a ventilator, however he died half an hour later. No necropsy was
performed, but based on his laboratory work, the clinical history of having vomited coins,
zinc toxicity was the presumptive cause of death.


Animals may be exposed to zinc in batteries, paints, cosmetics, wood preservatives, zippers,
board game pieces and hardware in addition to pennies minted 1983 or afterward. While
metallic zinc is poorly reactive, solubilization by acid in the stomach leads to absorption and
toxicity. Toxic effects include direct irritation to the gastric mucosa (which may be
exacerbated by the presence of foreign bodies), altered metabolism because of zinc’s
interference with other ions such as cadmium, calcium, copper, and iron, and anemia
secondary to impaired erythrocyte production and hemolysis. The exact mechanisms for
hemolysis are not always clear, however inhibition of red blood cell enzymes (especially those
protecting the cell from oxidative damage), membrane damage, and hapten-induced
immune destruction have been suggested (Cahill-Morasco). Therefore, both Heinz bodies
and spherocytes may be seen in patients with zinc toxicosis. Because of the presence of
spherocytes, hemolysis, and a regenerative anemia, immune-mediated hemolytic anemia may
be a differential diagnosis. Coombs’ testing may be POSITIVE in zinc toxicosis patients in the
absence of a primary immune mediated disease because of non-specific adsorption of
proteins to red blood cell membranes that have been damaged by the zinc, or because of
the presence of zinc on the red blood cell surface.


Zinc may cause hepatocellular and pancreatic damage, leading to elevations in ALP, ALT, AST,
amylase and lipase. Toxic damage could be compounded by poor oxygenation of tissues
associated with severe anemia and inadequate perfusion from dehydration and low cardiac
output resulting from the arrhythmia. Increased BUN and phosphorus, and possible elevated
amylase could result from kidney damage associated with heavy metal intoxication or toxic
effects of hemoglobin. Pre-renal azotemia from dehydration is also a possibility given the
history of vomiting; because the patient is anemic and may have liver disease, the packed
cell volume and albumin do not necessarily reflect hydration status and clinical indicators
must be used. A urine specific gravity is needed to assess urinary concentrating ability, and
the red urine noted in the history is likely to be hemoglobinuria from the hemolysis. Granular


casts are occasionally noted in urine samples from zinc toxicosis patients because of renal
tubular necrosis. Jimbo is likely to have glucosuria since the renal tubular threshold for
glucose reabsorption has been exceeded, however renal tubular dysfunction can lead to
glucosuria even in normoglycemic patients (this has been observed in patients with lead
poisoning). Glucosuria will occur regardless of the cause of the hyperglycemia and the
subsequent osmotic diuresis could interfere with Jimbo’s urinary concentrating ability,
therefore a finding of isosthenuria should be interpreted with caution.


Prolongations of the PT and APTT have been described with zinc toxicosis; zinc may directly
or indirectly interfere with the enzymatic functions of the coagulation proteins.

Overview
Step 1: Rule out any processing abnormalities that could influence your data, such as
prolonged in vitro contact of serum with cells (Case 3).


Step 2: Consider temporary physiological states that may influence an analyte such as a
recent meal (hypertriglyceridemia in Case 1), stress (hyperglycemia in Case 2), or dehydration
(hyperamylasemia). CBC data may provide supportive data such as a corticosteroid or
epinephrine leukogram for stress or polycythemia, or hyperalbuminemia and prerenal
azotemia for dehydration.


Step 3: Endocrinopathies are important causes for abnormalities of glucose, cholesterol, and
triglyceride. This was also true for abnormalities of liver enzymes. Carefully screen the CBC
and biochemical profile data for other abnormalities that would suggest an endocrinopathy
such as hypothyroidism (Case 10), hyperthyroidism, hypoadrenocorticism (Case 12), hyperadrenocorticism (Case 17), or diabetes mellitus (Case 18, 19, 20). Additional testing is often
required to confirm the presence of an endocrinopathy.


Step 4: Evaluate organs known to influence these analytes for evidence of pathology.
Specifically, liver disease can result in abnormalities of glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides
(Case 7, 21). Pancreatic disease can also impact these analytes, in addition to causing
elevations in serum amylase and lipase (Case 13, 14, 15). Remember to consider the close
relationship between the pancreas and liver as pathology may be present in both organs
(Case 16). Renal disease can cause increases in amylase and lipase (Case 20, 21) and can be
associated with altered lipid metabolism (see Chapter 5). As seen in step 3, further testing
beyond the CBC, serum biochemical profile, and urinalysis are often required to confirm a
specific diagnosis.


Step 5: Some types of neoplasia (Case 4, 5, 6, 13, 14), systemic infections (Case 8, 9), or
medications and toxins (Case 11, possible Case 21) may influence analytes.

##### Serum Proteins


Review of Proteins
Albumin makes up approximately 35-50% of the total serum protein in most domestic
animals. It is synthesized in the liver and functions as a storage pool of protein and
transporter of amino acids. In addition, albumin acts as a general binding and transport
protein that can prevent loss of constituents via the kidneys. Albumin accounts for
approximately 75% of the osmotic activity of the plasma because it is small and abundant.


Globulin proteins account for the majority of the non-albumin protein measured in the blood.
When separated by electrophoresis, alpha globulins include lipoproteins and some acute
phase reactants. Beta globulins include other acute phase reactants and some
immunoglobulins, while gamma globulins are predominantly immunoglobulins.
