GI Case 6 – Level 1
“Russell” is a 10-year-old neutered male Jack Russell Terrier presenting for work-up of possible
liver disease. He has suffered four brief seizures in the last several months that appear to be
associated with food consumption. The seizure episodes last about five minutes and they
consist of trembling and the appearance of not be being mentally “present”; he does not
paddle or lose control of his bladder or bowel. Russell is otherwise healthy, and on physical
examination, he is bright, alert, and responsive with no abnormalities noted. On abdominal
radiographs, Russell’s liver appears to be small. This impression is confirmed with ultrasonography, however the liver is thought to be architecturally and texturally normal. No splenic
or renal abnormalities are noted, however a nodule is identified in the left limb of the pancreas.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: The CBC is unremarkable except for a mild decrease in the RBC count. This may
indicate a developing mild anemia of chronic disease since the hematocrit is at the low end
of the reference interval. Alternatively, these values may be normal for this patient as a result
of normal biological variation. Repeat blood work could be considered to determine if there
is a decreasing trend in the erythrocyte values.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: Once processing errors were ruled out, true hypoglycemia was suspected
based on the “seizure” episodes. The pancreatic nodule is of concern, and insulinoma should
be considered. Simultaneous measurement of glucose and insulin levels under fasted
conditions are recommended. Impaired gluconeogenesis associated with liver failure can
cause hypoglycemia (see Chapter 2, Case 21), although this is relatively uncommon. Other
laboratory abnormalities associated with markedly decreased liver function include hypoalbuminemia, hypocholesterolemia, prolonged PT and APTT and occasionally mild hyperbilirubinemia, but none of these supporting abnormalities are observed in this case. Because none
of measured parameters on the clinical chemistry profiles are sensitive or specific for the
detection of decreased liver function, measurement of serum bile acids and/or blood
ammonia are recommended because of the small liver. Remember that normal liver enzyme
levels in the blood do not rule out liver disease. Clinical and laboratory findings make sepsis
extremely unlikely.


Mild increase in ALP: This is an extremely non-specific finding in the dog (see Chapter 2).
Corticosteroids and other drugs may induce elevations in ALP, however Russell does not have


a corticosteroid leukogram, nor does he have a history of taking any medications. In the
absence of other physical or laboratory evidence of liver disease, the significance of this
elevation is unclear. Repeat sampling in 4-6 weeks is recommended, or sooner if the clinical
condition changes.


Coagulation Profile: Within normal limits

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

An aspirate smear of the liver was evaluated and found to be normal. Simultaneous fasting
glucose and insulin levels were performed. Insulin was 48.8 IU/ml with a fasting glucose was 56
mg/dl, compatible with insulinoma. Normally insulin should be 2-25 IU/ml when glucose is
between 70-100. Russell was treated with corticosteroids, frequent meals and avoidance of
strenuous exercise until his tumor was surgically removed and confirmed to be an insulinoma by
histologic examination of biopsy specimens. Unfortunately, resection was incomplete. Russell
continued to do well at home on corticosteroid therapy for 18 months, after which he
presented again after a low glucose measurement at the referring veterinarian’s clinic. This
laboratory abnormality was not associated with clinical signs that the owner had noticed.
Repeat blood work at this time confirmed the low glucose and revealed a corticosteroid
leukogram and elevated ALP, which may be attributed to corticosteroid treatment, though
other causes cannot be ruled out.


Although thoracic radiographs were clear of metastases, abdominal ultrasound showed
multiple liver nodules. Cytology of these nodules revealed small numbers of normal
hepatocytes with sheets and small clusters of cells indicative of a neuroendocrine tumor
compatible with insulinoma (Figure 3-3). Fasting insulin level measured on the same serum as
the 18-month serum biochemical profile was 264 IU/ml, compatible with recurrence of
disease. Russell was discharged from the hospital on medical therapy with a guarded
prognosis.


This case was initially referred in for evaluation of liver disease, which was never definitively
ruled out, however seemed unlikely to be the primary cause of the clinical signs given the
preponderance of evidence. Russell’s small liver and “neurologic signs” could have been
compatible with poor hepatic function, but as noted above, other supportive laboratory data
were lacking. The clinical presentation and laboratory findings were similar to the same disease
in Ides, the ferret in the previous case. Interestingly, despite the confirmed presence of
metastatic disease in the liver, hepatic enzyme changes were minimal and likely related to the
corticosteroid therapy. This is similar to Kippy, who had an extremely large liver tumor and
mostly unremarkable liver enzyme data.


Figure 3-3. Smears consist of small
clusters of uniform oval to
polyhedral cells characterized by
moderate to marked amounts of
pale blue cytoplasm. Cells have
one or two small round to oval
nuclei. These findings were
considered to be compatible with
metastatic insulinoma.


GI Case 7 – Level 1
“Yap Yap” is a 6-month-old West Highland White terrier presenting with a history of foreign
body ingestion (she passed a knee-high nylon stocking in the stool). Yap Yap continued to
have intermittent vomiting after passing the stocking, so blood work was performed.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Yap Yap has a mild normocytic normochromic non-regenerative anemia compatible with
chronic disease.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: Assuming appropriate sample collection and processing and considering the
age of the patient, decreased liver function or potentially a congenital metabolic defect
should be considered. There is no evidence of sepsis, and the patient’s nutrition is adequate.
Based on the age of the patient, neoplasia is very unlikely.


Decreased BUN: Hepatic insufficiency and dietary protein restriction may result in BUN
below the reference range. Increased excretion with polyuria can contribute as well.


Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia: Hypoalbuminemia may result from decreased
production, increased losses, or a combination of both causes. Some degree of intestinal
protein loss is possible and suggested by the history, but decreased production secondary to
poor liver function also may be a factor. This possibility is supported by the concurrent low
BUN, hypocholesterolemia, and dilute urine. As seen with decreased BUN, starvation can
trigger increased catabolism of serum albumin and may compromise production of this
protein, but seems unlikely in this case. There is no significant renal loss of protein noted on
the urinalysis, although given the dilute urine, a urinary protein:creatinine ratio could be
performed as a more sensitive test for proteinuria.


Very mild increase in ALP: This minimal elevation may be attributable to numerous hepatic
and extrahepatic processes (see Chapter 2). In a 6-month-old dog, bone isoenzyme should
be considered, however YapYap is a small breed dog and is less likely than a larger dog to
have increased bone ALP due to skeletal growth at this age. With the concurrent increase in
ALT, a liver insult may be present and increased ALP can suggest a cholestatic component,
although bilirubin is currently within reference intervals. Inflammatory processes of the
intestine that might be expected with foreign body ingestion can involve the liver by either
direct extension or via the portal blood. Enzyme induction by medications such as corticosteroids and anticonvulsants should be ruled out.


Increase in ALT: Elevation in ALT indicates some degree of hepatocellular damage, but is not
specific for any particular cause. Hepatocellular damage may occur secondary to intestinal
pathology and exposure of the liver to increased endotoxin, bacteria, and inflammatory
mediators carried from damaged intestines by the portal circulation. Alternatively, primary
liver disease is also possible. Hypoxia secondary to anemia is possible, but is less likely with
mild or slowly developing anemias.


Hypocholesterolemia: Decreased liver function, protein losing enteropathy or severe
malnutrition could diminish serum cholesterol. The combination of low serum glucose, BUN,
albumin, and cholesterol is very suggestive for decreased liver function, however gastrointestinal protein loss cannot be ruled out given the history and low-normal globulin values.


Decrease in Amylase: A decrease in enzyme activity is not considered a clinically significant
finding.


Urinalysis: Yap Yap is isosthenuric, but not azotemic. Interpretation of isosthenuria as
physiologic or pathologic depends on clinical information such as hydration status. Because
impaired ability to concentrate urine appears prior to azotemia, decreased renal function
cannot be ruled out. Liver failure may also interfere with renal concentrating ability in the
absence of pathology in the kidney.


###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

The combination of hypoglycemia, low BUN, hypoalbuminemia, and hypocholesterolemia in
the absence of starvation or severe malnutrition suggests decreased liver function. PT and
APTT were not evaluated, but may have been prolonged in this case because of diminished
production of coagulation factors by the liver. Elevations in ALP and ALT also support hepatic
pathology, but do not provide a specific diagnosis, nor are they liver function tests. Based on
the suspicion of impaired liver function, serum bile acid levels were performed and confirmed
decreased liver function: fasted: 62.9 µmol/L (reference interval = 0.0-5.0), post-prandial
197.7 µmol/L (reference interval = 5.0-25.0).


It was concluded that the isosthenuria was likely related to liver disease. Polyuria and
polydipsia are a frequent signs of liver disease in dogs and may have contributed to the low
urine specific gravity in this patient. Abnormal neurotransmitters overstimulate the pituitary,
leading to increased ACTH secretion and hypercortisolism. As a result, the osmotic threshold
for ADH release is increased so higher plasma osmolality is required to stimulated antidiuresis. When patients become significantly dehydrated, the new threshold is reached so
significant dehydration is not common. Reduced urea formation in the liver may also
decrease urinary concentrating ability. Other poorly understood mechanisms probably
contribute as well.


Imaging studies revealed a small liver and a portal-caval shunt, which was repaired with an
ameroid constrictor ring. Wedge biopsy specimens collected at surgery revealed absence or
atrophy of hepatic venules and proliferation of arterioles compatible with portosystemic
shunt or microvascular dysplasia. Yap Yap appeared energetic and healthy prior to sugery,
and the procedure and immediate post-operative recovery period were uneventful.
Unfortunately, seven days after discharge, she presented for lethargy, anorexia, and a
markedly distended abdomen. On physical examination, Yap Yap was quiet but responsive
and had pale mucous membranes. Abdominal radiographs revealed poor abdominal detail,
and ultrasound studies showed a thrombus near the ameroid constrictor with markedly
decreased blood flow to the mesentery. Yap Yap died shortly after the procedure, no postmortem examination was performed.


GI Case 8 – Level 1
“Freeze” is a one-day-old premature alpaca cria presenting with a history of seizures the
previous day, increased respiration, dull mentation, and abrasions over both carpi and both
hocks. Prior to referral, she was febrile and had been treated with subcutaneous fluids,
antibiotics, and colostrum from her dam. On physical examination she is dull, recumbent, and
febrile. (Note: neonatal reference intervals are published for the llama; see Fowler)
