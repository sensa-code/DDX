###### **Interpretation**

CBC: The mild normocytic normochromic anemia is actually within published reference
intervals for a puppy of Spunky’s age. Total protein at the low end of the reference interval is
also appropriate for a young puppy and is due to low globulin levels, but under other
circumstances might suggest blood loss. This data illustrates the need to verify appropriate
reference intervals for pediatric patients. Given Spunky’s history of apparently ingesting glass,
the PCV should be monitored along with careful observation for any signs of blood loss,
especially via the gastrointestinal tract.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperphosphatemia with hypercalcemia: This combination in a young, large breed dog is
most likely normal during this period of rapid skeletal growth. Differential diagnoses for
hyperphosphatemia with concurrent hypercalcemia in adult dogs include renal failure, vitamin
D toxicosis, and hypoadrenocorticism. Spunky’s other laboratory data and his clinical history
are not supportive of any of these diagnoses.


Mildly increased ALP (1.5x): As indicated in the introduction, there are many hepatic and
extrahepatic causes of increased ALP in the dog. In young, growing dogs, mild increases in
ALP are normal and associated with bone growth. ALP allows mineral to be deposited in
bone (Kronenberg). A complete medical history should include questions about exposure to
any medications that could induce ALP.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Normal findings for a young large breed dog


This combination of “abnormalities” constitutes normal physiology in this patient, who is very
unlikely to have liver disease. Spunky was discharged with no further problems.

Liver Case 2 – Level 1
“Bandit” is a 1.5-year-old spayed female Labrador Retriever that was presented after the
owners observed her being struck on her left thorax by a truck. The dog was thrown in the
air, landed, and initially did not move. After a few minutes, she rose and started walking, but
her front legs collapsed. At this point she lay on the grass crying. She has been treated in the
past for pyoderma, but is not currently on any medications.


On physical examination, Bandit has bruising in the left axillary region, an abrasion on the
medial aspect of the left radius and ulna, and a swelling on the thoracic wall caudal to the
point of the left elbow. She is lame and painful on her left front leg, but otherwise, appears
bright and alert. Radiographs of the chest, abdomen and left leg show only a mild
pneumothorax. She was admitted to the hospital for observation.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: The release of endogeneous corticosteroids due to the stress of the injuries could
produce a lymphopenia.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Increased ALT and AST (15-20x): Significant elevation of these two enzymes supports an
interpretation of hepatocellular damage. The normal ALP and GGT indicates that cholestasis
is not a factor in this case at this time. While ALT is relatively liver specific in small animal
patients, AST could be compatible with some damage to muscle tissue or other organs. If
muscle damage is very severe, ALT may increase due to leakage from muscle as well
(Swenson). A serum CK level could be run to assess muscle damage, however, it is likely to
be elevated in this case due to the trauma. The most likely cause for the Bandit’s increased
hepatocellular enzymes is trauma to the liver, though transient hypoperfusion of the liver due
to shock following the accident could also be a factor.


Urinalysis: Bandit’s urinalysis shows well-concentrated alkaline urine with small numbers of
red and white blood cells. The presence of protein and heme are compatible with blood
contamination from the cystocentesis procedure, or with hemorrhage secondary to trauma of
the urogenital tract. Trace to 1+ (30 mg/dl) protein often is not significant when detected in a
concentrated urine sample. However, false positive reactions for protein may be seen on
urine dipstick results performed on alkaline urine. Carnivores generally have aciduria and
alkaline urine may indicate the presence of urease positive bacteria. Transient alkaline urine
may be observed postprandially.


Dogs have a low renal threshold for conjugated bilirubin and detection of a trace to 1+
bilirubin is not unusual, especially in concentrated urine. In the dog, bilirubin can be
observed in the urine prior to any detectible rise in serum bilirubin concentrations.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Bandit was discharged the next morning with medication for control of pain. She had an
uneventful recovery.

Liver Case 3 – Level 1
“Chewie” is a 6-year-old castrated male Bouvier who began showing signs of lameness in the
left front limb approximately one month ago. The referring veterinarian initially diagnosed
osteochondritis dessicans and prescribed a nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory drug. On
presentation, Chewie is painful and has swelling in the region of his left proximal humerus.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: The mild changes in lymphocyte and eosinophil numbers may be normal variation.
Lymphopenia may be secondary to endogenous corticosteroid release or stress. However,
the presence of a mild eosinophilia makes a steroid response less likely. Increases in


eosinophils may be seen with parasitic disease or hypersensitivity reactions. The remainder of
the CBC appears within normal limits.


Increased ALP (2.5x): This relatively mild elevation in ALP is quite nonspecific by itself. Due
to the numerous causes for increased ALP in the dog, interpretation is heavily dependent on
clinical information. In the context of Chewie’s history and physical examination findings,
increased ALP due to bone disease seems likely. While osteomyelitis is a possibility, so is
osteosarcoma. As always, the possibility of endocrine disorders and exposure to medications
that could induce increased ALP expression should be ruled out.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Increased ALP secondary to bone disease


In contrast to Spunky (Case 1), Chewie is too old to expect ALP to be elevated due to normal
skeletal growth. No medications that could induce ALP were given. While a lymphopenia may
support a corticosteroid response, the lymphopenia observed in Chewie is very mild and the
rest of the CBC is not consist with a stress or “steroid” leukogram. While some non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory medications have been reported to cause liver failure in some dogs, this is
associated with jaundice and elevations of not only ALP but also ALT and AST, which were not
present in this patient.


Radiographs demonstrated a lytic lesion in the proximal humerus, however thoracic films
were clear of evidence of metastatic disease. Please note that this does not rule out the
presence of microscopic metastases, which are often present at the time of diagnosis of
osteosarcoma. Cytologic evaluation of aspirates from the lytic lesion (Figure 2.1) were
consistent with osteosarcoma. Chewie’s limb was amputated, and biopsy showed
osteosarcoma with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. Dogs with osteosarcoma have shorter
survival times and disease free intervals if the serum ALP is elevated at the time of diagnosis
(Ehrhart, Kirpensteijn, Liptak). In this case, the serum biochemical profile helped support the
clinical diagnosis and provided additional prognostic information.


Figure 2-1. Smears of aspirates
from a lytic bone lesion consisted
of numerous round to oval to
spindle shaped mesenchymal cells
with abundant pale blue cytoplasm.
Most cells had a single round to
oval nucleus that was often
eccentrically placed consistent with
neoplastic osteoblasts. Features of
malignancy such as anisocytosis
and anisokaryosis were marked.
Bright pink extracellular material
compatible with osteoid was noted.

Liver Case 4 – Level 1
“Beauty” is a 1.5-year-old miniature mare that presented with a history of a difficult labor of
several hours duration. A partial fetotomy was performed in the field, but it could not be
completed. On presentation, Beauty was painful with an elevated heart and respiratory rate.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: Beauty has leukopenia characterized by neutropenia and lymphopenia. The toxic
changes in the neutrophils and the increased fibrinogen indicate inflammation. Thus, the
neutropenia is secondary to acute, overwhelming inflammation that is depleting the
neutrophils in the peripheral blood. The lymphopenia is probably caused by release of
endogenous corticosteroids secondary to stress in this patient.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Stress is the most likely cause for hyperglycemia in this patient.


Hyperbilirubinemia with increased indirect bilirubin: Anorexia in horses will result in
increased indirect bilirubin. Decreased liver function is another possibility, however we have
no test results that specifically evaluate liver function here. Serum bile acids and blood
ammonia can be performed as more specific tests of liver function. Sepsis can lead to
decreased removal of bilirubin from the blood because endotoxin can inhibit hepatocellular
uptake of bilirubin. The neutropenia with toxic changes is also compatible with sepsis.
Hemolysis is an unlikely cause of hyperbilirubinemia in this patient, because she has a normal
PCV.


Increased AST (30x) and CK (79x) with normal GGT: AST may increase with either
hepatocellular damage or muscle damage, while the markedly increased CK is strong
evidence for muscle damage. In combination with a normal GGT, the most likely source for
the elevated AST in this patient is muscle.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Acute overwhelming inflammation (sepsis and/or metritis), muscle trauma, anorexia, and stress.
