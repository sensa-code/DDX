Hyperkalemia followed by hypokalemia: Serum potassium does not accurately reflect total
body potassium, and rapid changes in potassium over time may occur associated with
changes in renal tubular flow rates and fluctutations in acid/base status. On Day 2, urine flow
has been re-established, and Simba is experiencing post-obstructive diuresis with kaliuresis.


HCO3 and anion gap: The increased HCO3 in combination with hypochloremia could
indicate a mixed acid/base disorder. The low anion gap on day 2 probably reflects hypoproteinemia, while the markedly increased HCO3 suggests alkalemia. The dramatic change in
acid/base status over one day in this case is due to overzealous administration of sodium
bicarbonate in response to the previous acidemia.

###### **Case Summary**

Simba can be compared with Ringo (Chapter 5, Case 7). Both cats had clinical signs compatible
with urinary obstruction, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, similar degrees of azotemia, and
dilute urine. Both cats were hyperkalemic because the urinary obstruction prevented adequate
potassium excretion. Both cats also had low serum chloride, with serum sodium values low or
near the lower limit of the reference interval. Both cats also had serum bicarbonate levels near
the lower limit of the reference interval initially (possibly uremic acidosis or lactic acidosis), but
Simba’s treatment with bicarbonate induced an iatrogenic alkalosis on Day 2. Another
significant change in Simba’s blood work on Day 2 is the rapid drop in serum potassium level
that is associated with relief of the urinary tract obstruction and subsequent diuresis. It is likely
that Ringo experienced a similar decline, however serial data was not available. This rapid
fluctuation in potassium status could be seen in any patient that experiences a marked increase
in glomerular filtration rate, for example after correction of extreme dehydration.

Case 21 – Level 3
“José” is a 1.5-year-old miniature donkey that was castrated three weeks ago. After surgery,
there appeared to be excessive swelling around the incision. He has been straining to urinate
since then. At presentation, José has bilateral abdominal distention with moderate swelling
of the sheath of the penis and in the dependent inguinal areas. He is tachypneic, tachycardic,
and depressed. No gut sounds are detected. He has not urinated for several days and
stopped passing manure two days ago. (The reference intervals provided are for horses and
are not specific for donkeys.)

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: José has a neutrophilic leukocytosis and monocytosis with hyperfibrinogenemia,
indicating inflammation.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Common causes of hyperglycemia in horses include stress or excitement
associated with transport or pain, corticosteroid therapy, or Cushing’s syndrome. Diabetes
mellitus is rare in equids.


Azotemia: Because of the anuria, no urine specific gravity is available to classify the azotemia
on the basis of urinary concentrating ability. The abdominal fluid analysis and creatinine
points to uroabdomen and a post-renal azotemia. Intravascular fluid volume contraction may
result in a pre-renal component as well.


Hypocalcemia: Gastrointestinal disease, renal disease, and sepsis may be associated with
hypocalcemia in Equidae (Toribio). José has evidence of urinary obstruction. Hypocalcemia is
most typical of acute renal failure and is often accompanied by hyperphosphatemia, which is
not present here. Sepsis is possible given the inflammatory leukogram. Poor gastrointestinal
absorption is possible with decreased gut sounds. Ionized calcium measurement would
provide more information about the likelihood that José will develop clinical signs of
hypocalcemia, but at this point the calcium may normalize with correction of the underlying
disorders.


Hypermagnesemia: In this case, the hypermagnesemia is due to the anuria and subsequent
failure to eliminate magnesium in the urine. Hypermagnesemia is rare in large animal species
and is more often the result of oversupplementation or treatment with magnesium containing
products.


Hyperproteinemia with hyperglobulinemia: Increased production of acute phase reactants
such as fibrinogen and/or increased production of immunoglobulins in response to antigenic
stimulation are causing the changes in serum proteins.


Mild hyponatremia with disproportionately greater hypochloremia: Multiple mechanisms
are contributing to the hyponatremia and hypochloremia. There is loss of electrolytes into the
abdominal effusion as a result of a ruptured bladder. Horses produce hypertonic sweat with a
relatively high concentration of chloride, and this may be an additional route for loss of
electrolytes if José has been sweating due to pain. Osmotic draw of additional fluid from
extracellular spaces into the circulation by excessive amounts of glucose could dilute the
remaining sodium. There may be an artifactual lowering of sodium and chloride with severe
lipemia if the chemistry analyzer employs indirect potentiometry with ion specific electrodes
in which the sample is diluted as part of the assay. The corrected chloride is 84 mEq/L, which


indicates that additional forces are acting on chloride. Hypochloremia is often noted in
association with metabolic alkalosis, which is present in this case. Digestive disturbances
resulting in loss or sequestration of chloride containing fluid can lower serum chloride, and
this may be possible considering the decreased gut sounds and failure to pass manure.


Hyperkalemia: Accumulation of potassium in the serum can occur when glomerular filtration
rate drops sufficiently to prevent elimination of potassium in the urine. In this case, pooling of
urine in the abdomen allows translocation of potassium back into the circulation from the
abdominal cavity to re-establish equilibrium of potassium concentrations across the semipermeable serosal lining.


Increased bicarbonate (alkalemia): Sequestration or loss of acid or chloride containing fluids
will precipitate alkalosis. Alkalosis also may be perpetuated by the need to conserve sodium
and the relative deficit of chloride. When sodium is resorbed in the proximal tubule, an anion
must follow to maintain electrical neutrality. When chloride is not available in adequate
quantities, increased amounts of sodium are present in the distal tubule. Sodium resorption
will be coupled with hydrogen loss and generation of bicarbonate, maintaining the alkalosis.


Increased ALP and GGT: The combination of elevations in ALP and GGT suggest
hepatobiliary disease. Severe cholestasis seems unlikely because the serum bilirubin is within
reference intervals. In large animal species, the GGT is considered a more reliable indicator of
liver disease, and it is compatible with liver damage associated with hyperlipidemia. The GGT
value should be interpreted with caution, however, because the upper limit of the GGT
reference interval for donkeys and burros may be two to three times greater than that of
horses. Horse reference ranges are often used for these species as they were in this case,
potentially leading to errors of interpretation.


Increased AST: This enzyme is a nonspecific indicator of tissue damage, possibly liver in this
case. As with GGT, the upper limit of the reference interval may be higher for donkey’s.


Decreased CK: This individual value is not diagnostically significant, but does suggest that
the increase in AST is more likely to be associated with liver damage than muscle injury.


Hypertriglyceridemia: Increased serum triglycerides can be associated with metabolic
disorders, particularly hyperlipemia in horses, ponies, and donkeys. Note that serum
triglyceride values may be slightly higher in healthy donkeys compared to horses. Fasting
precipitates excessive fatty acid mobilization from adipose with subsequent increased
triglyceride synthesis and fatty infiltration of organs, including the liver. In this case, the
urinary tract disease may have depressed food intake and caused disease.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

José was taken to surgery for correction of his uroabdomen. Nutritional support was instituted
and he recovered from his hyperlipidemia. Like Simba, the obstructed cat (Chapter 7, Case
20), the inability to excrete urine from the body leads to excess potassium accumulation and
azotemia. In José’s case, the cause of the hyponatremia and hypochloremia is somewhat
clearer than for Simba. In addition to loss of electrolytes into the effusion, the same osmotic
effects that cause intravascular fluid shifts that diluted sodium and chloride in the
hyperglycemic alpaca (Chapter 7, Case 19) and cases of diabetes occur here as well. Sweating
is also a route for electrolyte loss in Equidae. The secondary hyperlipidemia could cause
artifactually low values for electrolytes if indirect potentiometry or flame photometry
methodology were used. Secondary metabolic disease may develop in anorexic horses,
resulting in complications not directly related to the primary disease. This was observed with


the hyperlipidemia and elevated liver enzymes that were not directly due to urinary tract
obstruction.

Case 22 – Level 3
“Pat” is a 6-year-old neutered male Cockapoo presenting for an episode of lethargy,
vomiting, and difficulty breathing. He was seen one day ago and the referring veterinarian
noted an enlarged heart and liver on radiographs. Pericardiocentesis yielded 185 ml of
hemorrhagic fluid. Pat was treated with antibiotics and vitamin K. On presentation to the
referral institution, Pat is weak but alert. He has injected sclera and bright pink mucous
membranes with prolonged capillary refill time. He is not febrile. His heart and respiratory
rates are elevated, and he has a grade III/VI systolic murmur.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Pat has a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis that is attributable to inflammation, although
the numbers of band neutrophils remain within the reference interval. Small numbers of
nucleated erythroid precursors are also noted in the circulation. These are often present as a
result of endothelial injury or lesions in hematopoietic tissues. In this case, hypoxemia
associated with diminished cardiac function or sepsis may cause endothelial damage and
release of erythroid precursors.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: Because of the inflammatory leukogram and the cytologic appearance of the
pericardial fluid, sepsis is an important differential diagnosis for the hypoglycemia, assuming
that no processing errors occurred. The hypoglycemia is mild and may not be associated with
clinical effects.


Increased BUN with normal creatinine: Because a urine specific gravity is not available for
this patient, renal function is difficult to evaluate. BUN may increase prior to creatinine early
in renal compromise or with decreased tubular flow rates associated with dehydration or
other causes of pre-renal azotemia such as decreased cardiac output. Sepsis may also cause
an increase in BUN but no change in creatinine. Consumption of a high protein diet can
elevate BUN.


Hyperphosphatemia: Decreased glomerular filtration rate is a common cause of hyperphosphatemia and is consistent with pre-renal azotemia in a patient that is dehydrated or has
impaired cardiac function. Tissue necrosis may increase serum phosphorus. However, there is
little evidence to support this mechanism without a CK, only a mildly increased AST, and the
potassium within reference intervals. Because the calcium is also low, hypoparathyroidism
also may be considered. The most likely cause of the hypocalcemia is decreased protein
bound calcium secondary to the hypoalbuminemia.
