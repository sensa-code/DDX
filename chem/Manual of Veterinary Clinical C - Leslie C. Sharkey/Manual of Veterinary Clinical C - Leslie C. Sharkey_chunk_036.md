Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia and isosthenuria: This combination of laboratory abnormalities in a dehydrated
patient is suggestive for renal failure, but there are exceptions when extra-renal factors
interfere with renal concentrating ability (See Chapter 5, Case 4). Osmotic diuresis, medullary
washout, and liver failure are unlikely based on the fact that all of the abnormalities on the
serum biochemical profile can be explained by renal disease alone. Diabetes insipidus is a
consideration, but is less likely.


Hyperphosphatemia and hypermagnesemia: The hyperphosphatemia and hypermagnesemia
are most likely attributable to decreased glomerular filtration rate.


Hypoalbuminemia: Increased losses of albumin appear most likely in this case, and include
the potential for hemorrhage discussed above and the documented excessive protein loss in


the urine. The inactive urine sediment makes lower urinary tract disease unlikely, and
glomerular loss of protein is suspected as the primary route of protein loss. Causes of
decreased production of albumin contributing to the hypoalbuminemia in this case may
include starvation, acute phase changes (albumin is a negative acute phase reactant), and
liver failure. Depending on her body condition, anorexia/cachexia may be a consideration,
but is usually only associated with extreme nutritional deprivation and poor body condition
(see Chapter 5, Case 3, Marsali). The toxic change in the neutrophils suggests inflammation
that could produce an acute phase response. Liver failure is unlikely given normal glucose,
cholesterol, and bilirubin, although these are insensitive indicators of liver function. Serum
bile acid or blood ammonia measurement is preferred to confirm poor hepatic function.


Hyperamylasemia: The most likely cause for this change is the decreased GFR, supported by
the azotemia and hyperphosphatemia. Clinical signs are vague, and pancreatic disease
cannot be completely ruled out.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Sheba had hypertension, assumed to be secondary to renal disease, and was treated with
antihypertensive medications. Cytologic examination of lymphoid tissue was consistent with
reactive hyperplasia and antigenic stimulation; however, there was no evidence of neoplasia.
Because of the shifting leg lameness, lymphoid hyperplasia, and thrombocytopenia, samples
were collected for serologic titers to Lyme disease, Ehrlichia, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever,
and Leptospirosis. All of the titers were negative except that for Lyme disease, which was
positive. Sheba was treated with appropriate antibiotics. During the second day of her hospitalization, Sheba developed petechia on her abdomen and legs. Intravenous fluid therapy
was initiated for her renal disease, however she developed severe edema after 24 hours, and
the fluids were discontinued. Both the hypoproteinemia and the potential for vasculitis could
have potentiated the development of edema. At discharge, Sheba’s treatment plan included
antibiotics, antihypertensive medications, and subcutaneous fluids.


No kidney biopsy was performed, however hypoalbuminemia with proteinuria and no
evidence of lower urinary tract disease or pyelonephritis is strong evidence of glomerular
disease. Clinical signs associated with glomerular disease can be varied and non-specific. At
least in the early phases of the disease, significant glomerular disease can be present without
significant changes in glomerular filtration rate or BUN and creatinine. The degree of
azotemia and the progression of disease may depend on the type of glomerular disease.
Classification requires biopsy which may not be performed because of the risk of further
renal injury and hemorrhage, which is higher in patients with coagulopathy and hypertension.
Sheba currently has both of these risk factors. Glomerular damage eventually leads to loss of
nephrons and chronic renal failure, however the progression of disease is variable and some
patients with glomerular disease may have stable renal function for extended periods of
time. In Sheba’s case, the history of shifting leg lameness and reactive lymphoid hyperplasia
suggest the possibility of antigen:antibody complex deposition as a cause for
glomerulopathy. Lyme disease itself can be associated with a rapidly progressive membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis accompanied by tubular lesions and interstitial inflammation,
culminating in renal failure (Dambach). Substantiating a diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in dogs
is complicated by the absence of a pathognomonic signs of infection such as the presence of
the erythrema migrans rash in people. In most dogs, measurable antibody production occurs
prior to the development of clinical signs (Fritz). Many clinically healthy dogs will test positive
for exposure to the Lyme borrelia due to natural exposure or vaccination. Immunoblot band
patterns can distinguish antibody production in response to natural exposure from the
response to vaccination. Because of a significant rate of false positive tests and the large


numbers of dogs in which exposure can be documented, but clinical disease never develops,
testing for Lyme disease should be restricted to patients with suggestive history and clinical
signs (Fritz).

Cytology of bladder mass: Smears are excellent quality with many variably sized clusters of
anaplastic epithelial cells mixed with debris, scattered nondegenerate neutrophils,
individualized transitional cells with cytoplasmic tails, and broken cells. The cells within
clusters are polyhedral with scant to moderate deeply basophilic cytoplasm. The cytoplasm
occasionally contains small clear vacuoles and rarely a single large pink inclusion that
peripheralizes the nucleus. Nuclei are large and round to oval with coarse chromatin and
multiple prominent nucleoli. Occasional cells with two to three nuclei are also present.
Anisocytosis and anisokaryosis are moderate to marked. The nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio is
high but variable. Occasionall extracellular yeast similar to those seen in the urine are
present; rare extracellular rod shaped bacteria are seen.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Unremarkable


Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia and isosthenuria: This combination of laboratory abnormalities is suggestive for renal
failure, and the ultrasound findings demonstrate a cause for post-renal obstruction of urine flow
with the secondary development of renal lesions resulting in renal failure. If the patient is
dehydrated, a pre-renal component may be superimposed on the other causes of azotemia.


Hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcemia: The hyperphosphatemia is the result of decreased
glomerular filtration rate, whether due to renal or pre-renal factors. Calcium changes
unpredictably in renal failure, and total calcium may be high, low or normal. In older patients,
hypercalcemia of malignancy must also be considered. Hypercalcemia has rarely been


reported in people with transitional cell carcinoma (Grubb) and may be related to the
presence of bone metastases in animals with transitional cell carcinoma (Rosol). Further
characterization of the pathophysiology of the hypercalcemia might be possible by
measuring ionized calcium (which is most often high in hypercalcemia of malignancy and
most often, but not always, low in chronic renal failure), measuring parathyroid hormone
related protein (PTHrP), or documenting bone metastases.


Mild increase in total protein and globulin: The increase in total protein is accounted for by
an increase in globulins. This may reflect antigenic stimulation and is supported by the
presence of reactive lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and inflammation in the urine
sediment.


Mild acidemia (decreased HCO3) with increased anion gap: These changes reflect uremic
acidosis.


Hypochloremia: This may occur as a result of renal losses secondary to polyuria or may
reflect acid/base abnormalities.


Hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia: The most likely cause for this change is decreased
GFR, supported by the azotemia and hyperphosphatemia. Clinical signs are vague, and
pancreatic disease cannot be completely ruled out.


Cytology: Malignant epithelial neoplasia compatible with transitional cell carcinoma; mild
suppurative inflammation and opportunistic yeast infection.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Thoracic radiographs revealed multiple irregular nodules suggesting metastatic neoplasia.
Gucci had surgery to remove the urinary bladder mass and to place a transabdominal Foley
catheter. She was treated with chemotherapy for the tumor and antifungal drugs for the
yeast infection. Antibiotics were added when her urine culture was positive for bacteria as
well. Gucci’s azotemia resolved with intervenous fluid therapy. However she remained
isosthenuric after discharge from the hospital, and residual renal failure is likely given the
changes in the kidneys observed at ultrasound. Gucci was doing well at home several weeks
after discharge.


Gucci’s data demonstrate the effects of more severe and prolonged urinary tract obstruction
than was present in Sherpa, Chapter 5, Case 2, despite an identical underlying cause
(transitional cell carcinoma). Sherpa was fortunate in that one kidney was largely spared the
effects of obstruction, with the potential for renal function to remain above the threshold of
25% functional renal mass below which azotemia develops. Gucci also has other laboratory
data compatible with decreased renal function such as calcium, phosphorus, and acid/base
abnormalities. Like Sherpa, Gucci’s azotemia is less severe than that observed in the cat with
pre-renal azotemia in Chapter 5, Case 1, Marklar, re-emphasizing the limitations of BUN and
creatinine in consistently distinguishing pre-renal from renal or post-renal causes of azotemia.

Case 7 – Level 2
“Ringo” is a 3-year-old castrated male, domestic long hair cat presenting with a two to three
month history of intermittently urinating next to his litter box. One day prior to presentation,
Ringo urinated next to his box, but then did not urinate at all for the next 24 hours. On the
morning of presentation, Ringo was found lying near his water bowl. On physical examination,
Ringo is hypothermic and has a large, firm urinary bladder which is painful on palpation.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: The mild mature neutrophilic leukocytosis is compatible with inflammation.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Given the history, the most likely cause for the hyperglycemia and glucosuria
is stress, although supportive changes in the leukogram are not present. Diabetes mellitus
should also be considered if the hyperglycemia is persistent or is associated with other
suggestive clinical signs such as polyphagia, weight loss, and polyuria/polydipsia. Note that
the glucosuria merely reflects hyperglycemia that causes the glomerular filtrate to have a
glucose content that exceeds the renal tubular maximum for glucose reabsorption. A single
finding of glucosuria does not by itself justify a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.


Azotemia: Azotemia should be categorized as pre-renal, renal, or post-renal. The minimally
concentrated urine supports the possibility of renal dysfunction, however this does not rule
out a pre-renal component to the azotemia if there is clinical evidence of dehydration. The
presence of a large, firm bladder is suspicious, and this cat may have post-renal azotemia
related to urethral blockage.
