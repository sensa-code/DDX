###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: The mild lymphopenia is compatible with a corticosteroid/stress effect. There is
currently no mature neutrophilia or monocytosis, but these can be less consistent features of
the corticosteroid leukogram.


Erythrogram: The mild normocytic normochromic anemia may reflect the effects of chronic
disease or liver disease. The recent onset of dark stools and the hypoalbuminemia suggest
the potential for gastrointestinal blood loss as well. Blood loss anemias are typically
regenerative, however if the blood loss is mild, acute, or if other factors such as chronic
disease are blunting a response, they may appear non-regenerative. The anisocytosis,
polychromasia, and basophilic stippling could be compatible with some marrow response
and serial CBC’s with reticulocyte counts may demonstrate some marrow activity. The clinical
significance of a single nucleated erythrocyte/100 WBC is questionable and may be
encountered in a normal animal. Endothelial damage of any cause or lesions of the
hematopoietic tissues could result in premature release of nucleated erythroid precursors.


Thrombocytopenia: In combination with data from the coagulation profile, the thrombocytopenia could be compatible with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Because
there is also a non-regenerative anemia, primary marrow disorders could be considered,
however extramarrow causes can explain Austin’s CBC abnormalities.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: Artifactual hypoglycemia was ruled out in this case. Given the chronic history
of liver disease, decreased liver function and inadequate gluconeogenesis should be evaluated
as a potential cause for low blood glucose. Other abnormalities that would support this cause
include low BUN and albumin with evidence of ongoing liver disease (increased liver
enzymes), however specific tests of liver function such as serum bile acids and blood ammonia
should be performed (See Chapter 2). Nutritional factors are unlikely to cause hypoglycemia
unless the body condition score is low, and there are other signs of starvation. Paraneoplastic
hypoglycemia is possible, but not supported by the physical examination.


Low BUN: As described above, decreased liver function should be investigated as a cause for
low BUN in this case. Polyuria and polydipsia, which is likely in this case given the low urine
specific gravity, can also contribute to low BUN because of rapid tubular flow rates and
inadequate time for urea reabsorption (See Chapter 5, Case 22). The dark stools suggest
gastrointestinal bleeding, which conversely may increase BUN. It appears that the degree of
hemorrhage is insufficient to offset the decreases in BUN produced by the other mechanisms.


Hypocalcemia: Because a significant amount of total serum calcium is protein bound, low
serum protein is expected to decrease total serum calcium. The biologically active ionized
fraction is not expected to change, therefore clinical signs of hypocalcemia are unlikely.
Correction formulas have been developed for the dog, however their clinical application in
disease may be questionable (Schenck).


Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia: The low albumin with normal globulins suggests
selective loss or decreased production of albumin. Routes of protein loss include skin, third
space, the gastrointestinal tract, and the kidneys. Renal losses are most likely to be selective
for albumin; other types of protein loss are more likely to result in nonselective loss of both
albumin and globulins. Renal losses of protein are less likely in the absence of measurable
amounts of proteinuria, however Austin’s urine is dilute and a urine protein:creatinine ratio
may be a more sensitive measure of urine protein content. Inadequate production of albumin
by a poorly functional liver can also result in disproportionately low albumin and is likely in
this case. While some globulin proteins are produced in the liver, immunoglobulin production
is unaffected because it is extrahepatic. Globulins may even increase in patients with liver
failure as generalized immune stimulation can result from inadequate Kupffer cell surveillance
of portal blood and increased systemic exposure to bacteria and toxins from the gut. Some
gastrointestinal protein loss is suspected because of the dark stool, however if globulin
values were initially high because of the decreased liver function, the decrease attributable to
GI losses may merely bring previously increased values back into the normal range.


Hypokalemia: Poor intake combined with third space losses (ascites) and possible gastrointestinal losses of potassium explain the hypokalemia.


Hyperbilirubinemia: The major causes of hyperbilirubinemia are decreased liver function,
cholestasis, hemolysis or sepsis. Decreased liver function with or without cholestasis are likely
based on the serum biochemical profile. Hemolysis is possible because of the anemia,
however specific morphologic abnormalities of the erythrocytes such as spherocytes or Heinz
bodies that would explain hemolysis are not described. Like blood loss anemias, hemolytic
anemias are generally regenerative, however if mild or acute, there may be no evidence of
regeneration (see discussion of erythrogram above). There is no evidence of sepsis in the CBC
as a cause for increased serum bilirubin.


Increased ALP and GGT: While there are many nonspecific causes of increased ALP and GGT
in the dog (See Chapter 2), cholestasis and liver disease are the most likely source of the
increased enzymes in this case.


Increased ALT and AST: Increases in these enzymes indicate hepatocellular damage, but do
not imply a cause. The previous histologic diagnosis of chronic active hepatitis is sufficient to
account for hepatocellular damage. It is important to note that while increased liver enzymes
do provide evidence of hepatic pathology, they are not liver function tests. If sufficient
numbers of hepatocytes are lost, liver enzyme levels may return to baseline levels despite
continuing liver disease and decreased liver function. An acute decrease in PCV with
associated hypoxia could further damage liver cells. AST is less liver specific than the ALT and
may increase with muscle damage. Measurement of creatine kinase would help determine if
muscle damage could account for some of the increase in AST.


Coagulation profile: The prolonged clotting times, thrombocytopenia, and increased FDPs
are compatible with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Alternatively, sufficiently
impaired liver function will prevent production of adequate amounts of coagulation factors
and prolong the PT and APTT. In addition, because the liver is responsible for clearance of
fibrin degradation products, decreased liver function will also result in increased FDPs.
Regardless, the patient is still considered to have a coagulopathy.


Urinalysis: Polyuria can characterize liver failure (See Chapter 2 for details, also see Chapter
2, Case 10; Chapter 3, Case 7; Chapter 5, Case 12). The significance of small numbers of
leukocytes in the absence of bacteria in a voided sample is unclear, however urine culture
could be considered to rule out the possibility of a urinary tract infection.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

A repeat ultrasound of the liver revealed a small, irregularly nodular liver, compatible with
cirrhosis. Blood ammonia concentration was within the reference interval, however serum bile
acids were not measured. Blood ammonia is a less sensitive test of decreased liver function
than serum bile acids, and the preponderance of other laboratory data is compatible with
decreased liver function. Because of the availability of the previous liver histopathology result
and the abnormal coagulation data, another biopsy was not performed. Austin was
hospitalized and treated with intravenous fluids, antibiotics, gastroprotectants, and small
doses of diuretics to reduce the ascites. Minimal improvement was noted in the laboratory
values, however Austin appeared brighter and his ascites was reduced. He was discharged to
his owners on medical management with a guarded to poor long term prognosis.


Other cases of hypocalcemia and hypoalbuminemia related to decreased liver function
include hepatic lipidosis (Chapter 2, Case 11) and portosystemic shunt (Chapter 2, Case 12).
Recall that extrahepatic causes of hypoalbuminemia also can result in low total serum
calcium. Although low total serum calcium is often attributed to hypoalbuminemia, some
patients have significantly low serum albumin associated with a variety of conditions and yet
maintain total serum calcium concentrations within reference intervals. This is true for YapYap
(Chapter 3, Case 7), who presented with a portosystemic shunt and more severe hypoalbuminemia than Austin (1.8 g/dl compared with 2.2 g/dl), yet his total serum calcium was within
reference intervals. A variety of physiological influences including pH and competitive
binding of calcium or albumin with other substances in the blood can influence the
relationship of total serum calcium and albumin in individual patients.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: There is a normocytic, normochromic anemia, that is likely nonregenerative. The anemia
may be more severe once fluid deficits are corrected. Anemia of chronic disease is possible,
however the azotemia and relatively dilute urine in a dehydrated patient suggests renal
disease as a cause for non-regenerative anemia.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia and dilute urine with dehydration: This combination of laboratory abnormalities
is suggestive for renal failure, but there are exceptions when extra-renal factors interfere with
renal concentrating ability. If the patient is dehydrated, a pre-renal component may be
superimposed on the other causes of azotemia.


Hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcemia: The hyperphosphatemia is most likely attributable
to decreased glomerular filtration rate, whether due to renal or pre-renal factors. Calcium
changes unpredictably in renal failure, and total calcium may be high, low or normal. In
middle-aged and older patients, hypercalcemia of malignancy should also be considered
because cancer is an important cause of increased calcium in this demographic.


Hypermagnesemia: Decreased glomerular filtration rate causes increased serum magnesium.


Hypokalemia: Decreased intake associated with anorexia and increased losses via the
gastrointestinal tract combine with increased renal losses due to polyuria to lower serum
potassium values.


Mild hypochloremia: This is likely due to loss through vomiting.


Mild acidemia (decreased HCO3) with increased anion gap: These changes may be related
to uremic acidosis. Lactic acidosis from anemia and poor tissue perfusion secondary to
dehydration may also contribute to these laboratory abnormalities.


Hypercholesterolemia: Hypercholesterolemia has been described in canine patients with
glomerulonephritis and glomerular amyloidosis. Increases in cholesterol have been attributed
to a combination of increased hepatic synthesis and decreased catabolism of lipoproteins.
Decreased plasma albumin may stimulate hepatic synthesis of some lipoproteins, and
lipoprotein lipase required for lipid metabolism is decreased due to absence of stimulation
by heparin sulfate, which is often low in patients with nephrotic syndrome. Although
cholesterol levels are said to vary inversely with albumin, some renal disease patients with
hypoalbuminemia have normal cholesterol levels (Chapter 5, Case 5), while others have
normal serum albumin but elevated cholesterol (Chapter 5, Cases 10 and 17).


Hyperamylasemia: The most likely cause for this change is the decreased GFR, supported by
the azotemia and hyperphosphatemia. Clinical signs are vague and include gastrointestinal
abnormalities, so pancreatic disease cannot be completely ruled out.


Urinalysis: Because white blood cells were noted in a urine sample collected by cystocentesis,
the potential for a urinary tract infection should be evaluated by urine culture. The finding of
100 mg/dl of protein in a poorly concentrated urine sample is also of concern. A urine
protein:creatinine ratio is recommended as a more sensitive way to evaluate the proteinuria. It
is important to consider that the proteinuria may be the result of lower urinary tract disease
rather than glomerular lesions if there is evidence of inflammatory/infectious processes.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Star was treated with intravenous fluids, antihypertensive medication, and gastroprotectants.
Her urine culture was negative and the urine protein:creatinine ratio was markedly elevated,
compatible with glomerular disease. The clinicians decided against performing a renal biopsy
to confirm this impression because they did not feel that additional information that would
alter the treatment plan would be gained and they were concerned about complications from
the procedure. Star was discharged from the hospital, however she returned a week later
after developing diarrhea. On presentation she was very weak, and had pale mucous
membranes and melena. It was thought that Star had developed gastrointestinal ulceration
from uremia and she was humanely euthanized because of her poor prognosis.
