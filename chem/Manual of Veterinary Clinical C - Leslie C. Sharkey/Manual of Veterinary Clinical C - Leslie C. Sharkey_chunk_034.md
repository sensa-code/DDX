In general, as renal disease progresses, urinary concentrating ability is lost first, followed by
the development of azotemia. Cats may retain some concentrating ability despite the
presence of renal azotemia. By the time clinical signs of uremia develop, the patient is almost
always azotemic and isosthenuric. In contrast, patients may be azotemic for some period of
time prior to the development of uremia. To further classify the potential causes for
azotemia, the condition is described as pre-renal, renal, or post-renal. These three
descriptors of azotemia are not mutually exclusive; as will be seen in the cases, any of the
three may occur in any combination in a patient.


Pre-renal azotemia: This occurs when there is reduced renal perfusion because of
hypovolemia or reduced renal perfusion pressures. For example, uncompensated
hypovolemia associated with dehydration or hemorrhage can cause pre-renal azotemia.
Renal perfusion may be reduced because of low cardiac output secondary to primary
heart disease, or if blood pressure cannot be maintained because of systemic
vasodilation that is the result of shock or sepsis. When pre-renal azotemia occurs in
patients with normal renal function, the urine is generally concentrated, which helps rule
out renal azotemia. In some cases, however, extra-renal factors such as medullary
wash-out, osmotic diuresis, or endocrine disorders interfere with the kidney’s ability to
concentrate urine in the absence of significant renal parenchymal damage.


Renal azotemia: Primary renal parenchymal disease of any cause results in renal
azotemia. The presence or degree of confirmed renal azotemia does not distinguish an
acute from a chronic process. As will be seen below, BUN and serum creatinine are not
sensitive indicators of decreased renal function, and they may be influenced by extrarenal factors.


Post-renal azotemia: Failure of urine to be excreted from the body causes post-renal
azotemia, which is generally diagnosed by clinical signs such as minimal to absent
urinations and possible abdominal distension as urine accumulates. Physical obstruction
of urine flow and uroabdomen are two causes of post-renal azotemia. Please note that
some patients with post-renal azotemia may be able to pass small amounts of urine. The
obstruction of flow does not need to be complete to cause azotemia.


Although creatinine and BUN are most commonly thought of as indicators of renal function,
non-renal variables may influence these analytes.


Creatinine measured in the blood originates from either consumption of animal tissues or
from irreversible, non-enzymatic degradation of muscle creatine. Therefore, diet (unlikely to
be clinically significant), muscle mass, and muscle damage or breakdown could influence
serum creatinine concentrations. Volume expansion could dilute serum creatinine. Most of
the creatinine formed in the body is eliminated by the kidney, although small amounts may
be lost in sweat, in the gastrointestinal tract, or via biochemical recycling pathways.
Creatinine is freely filtered in the glomerulus, with a small amount of active transport into the
urine in some species. Decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increases serum creatinine,
while increased glomerular filtration can slightly decrease serum creatinine concentrations. In
general, creatinine is less influenced by extra-renal factors than BUN, however some
creatinine assays lack analytic specificity and will measure substances other than creatinine.
This may result in some variation in serum creatinine unrelated to changes in GFR in the
normal range of serum creatinine concentrations. These noncreatinine chromagens are
present in small, relatively constant quantities in the blood and this interference is unlikely to
make a normal animal appear to be azotemic or to significantly impact the degree of
azotemia in patients with renal failure.


Small amounts of urea are ingested in the diet, however the majority of blood urea nitrogen
is generated from protein derived ammonium by the urea cycle in the liver. Thus, similar to
creatinine, protein metabolism can influence BUN. High protein diets or increased muscle
catabolism can increase BUN, and there is some evidence that individuals with compromised
renal function may have impaired ability to eliminate an acute urea load even though they
may not be azotemic in the fasted state. Conversely, low muscle mass, low protein diet, or
poor urea cycle activity associated with liver failure may lower BUN. Some urea may be lost
in the gastrointestinal tract, and in ruminants, gut bacteria may utilize sufficient quantities to
blunt elevations in BUN when the GFR is compromised. Unlike creatinine, urea undergoes
some passive reabsorption in the collecting ducts. Higher tubular flow rates decrease the
amount of time available for reabsorption, and decrease BUN while low tubular flow rates
result in greater urea reabsorption. This means that changes in urine flow can alter BUN with
no significant change in total glomerular filtration rate.


As noted above, neither creatinine nor BUN is a sensitive indicator of decreased renal
function, and patients may have lost as much as 75% of renal function prior to the
development of azotemia. In addition, BUN and creatinine do not change linearly with further
decrements in renal function, so a patient whose creatinine doubles may have less than half
of the original glomerular filtration rate. The ability of non-renal factors to impact serum
creatinine and BUN can also contribute to variation in azotemia unrelated to true changes in
renal function. Finally, it should be noted that significant glomerular lesions can occur that
result in protein losing nephropathy in the absence of azotemia. Eventually, glomerular
lesions will cause tubular and interstitial pathology and nephron loss with resultant azotemia,
but this can occur late in the disease in some patients.


Case 1 – Level 1
“Marklar” is a 7-year-old castrated male, domestic shorthair cat that has been missing for 4
days. Marklar normally is an exclusively indoor cat. He returned home with some weight loss,
although his body condition is still good. He is obviously hungry and thirsty. His owners
request a health check and blood work. Marklar has tacky mucus membranes and a slightly
prolonged capillary refill time, but he otherwise appears healthy.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Marklar has a mature mild neutrophilia and lymphopenia consistent with a corticosteroid
leukogram, probably due to stress from being lost.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: The most likely cause for the mild hyperglycemia in this patient is stress, which
is supported by the concurrent corticosteroid leukogram. Diabetes mellitus cannot be ruled
out, but is unlikely based on the mild elevation of glucose, normal urinalysis, and absence of
typical clinical history. Note that despite several days of inadequate food intake, there is no
hypoglycemia (see Chapter 3 for further discussion of anorexia and serum glucose values).


Increased BUN and creatinine, hyperphosphatemia: These changes are indicators of
decreased glomerular filtration rate. The concentrated urine supports a pre-renal cause of
azotemia. Marklar has clinical signs as well as laboratory data (hyperalbuminemia and
hypernatremia with a proportionally high normal hyperchloremia) compatible with dehydration.


Hyperproteinemia due to hyperalbuminemia: The liver does not over-produce albumin,
therefore this value indicates dehydration.


Hypernatremia: Causes of hypernatremia include increased intake (possible but unlikely) or
dehydration with the loss of water exceeding the loss of electrolytes such as when access to
water is restricted. This is likely given the cat’s history of being lost for several days.


Urinalysis: Highly concentrated urine with no significant abnormalities.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Marklar was given a bolus of subcutaneous fluids and sent home with his owners. This is a
good example of pre-renal azotemia. Marklar had multiple laboratory abnormalities
compatible with dehydration because of a pure water deficit and no concurrent losses of
protein or erythrocytes. Many patients will be dehydrated and yet have normal electrolytes,
protein, or packed cell volume because losses of these analytes occur simultaneously with loss
of fluid or other factors are influencing their concentration in the blood. In addition, the
reference intervals for some of these analytes are wide, allowing for considerable change
without deviation from “normal” values. In these cases, clinical indicators of dehydration will
be more reliable than laboratory data to diagnose poor hydration status. Although Marklar
had no evidence of renal failure, in some patients dehydration may impose some degree of
pre-renal azotemia on top of renal azotemia. In these cases, isosthenuria does not rule out a
pre-renal component.


Case 2 – Level 1
“Sherpa” is a 10-year-old castrated male Collie presenting with a 5 month history of
hematuria and stranguria. He now requires 3-5 minutes to urinate and dribbles small
amounts. Sherpa was treated with antibiotics last month and 6 months ago. He has a history
of seizures which are well controlled by phenobarbital. On physical examination, Sherpa has
nuclear sclerosis in both eyes, severe dental tartar and moderate gingivitis. His abdomen is
taught and difficult to palpate.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Sherpa has a mild lymphopenia which is compatible with corticosteroid effects.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Elevated BUN and normal serum creatinine: Early pre-renal azotemia is possible if other
extra-renal causes of increased BUN are ruled out. However, the relatively low specific gravity
raises concerns about urinary concentrating ability. Reduced tubular flow rates may increase
the amount of time for reabsorption of urea and elevate levels in the blood even if there is
no decrease in the glomerular filtration rate. No fever, sepsis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, or
trauma are present in the history to suggest these potential causes of increased BUN with
normal creatinine.


Increased ALP and ALT: In this case, the most likely cause is induction by treatment with
anticonvulsants (see Chapter 2). Enzyme induction by corticosteroids or liver disease cannot
be completely ruled out without further testing.


Hypercholesterolemia: Hypercholesterolemia of this magnitude is unlikely to be physiologically significant in the dog, and post-prandial elevations should be ruled out first. Multiple
endocrinopathies can be associated with hypercholesterolemia, including diabetes (unlikely
with normal serum glucose), hypothyroidism (possible, but no compatible clinical signs
reported at this time), hyperadrenocorticism (possible as there is concurrent lymphopenia
and increased ALP, but no clinical signs), pancreatic and hepatic disease (possible with
increased liver enzymes and amylase, but, again, no compatible clinical signs), and renal
disease (possible, with clinical signs referable to the urinary system, but only mild elevation in
BUN). Idiopathic hypercholesterolemia may be ruled out by examination of any previously
normal serum biochemical data.


Hyperamylasemia: Mild elevations are associated with decreased glomerular filtration rate,
which is possible in this case, given the elevated BUN. Pancreatic disease may be considered
if appropriate clinical signs develop.


Urinalysis: The proteinuria and presence of erythrocytes and leukocytes suggest
inflammation of the urinary tract. Atypical epithelial cells may indicate the presence of
reactive epithelial hyperplasia in response to the inflammation. Alternatively, with the history
of stranguria, the potential for neoplasia with secondary inflammation should be evaluated by
imaging of the urinary tract.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Ultrasound evaluation of Sherpa’s urinary tract revealed an extensive tumor of the urinary
bladder which completely blocked the left ureter and resulted in hydronephrosis. The right
kidney was not involved, however there was mild ureteral dilation and hydronephrosis of the


right kidney as well. Cytologic examination of cells from the bladder mass showed sheets and
clusters of anaplastic transitional epithelial cells characterized by scant to abundant deeply
basophilic cytoplasm; occasional cells have cytoplasmic tails characteristic of transitional
epithelial cells (Figure 5-1). Rare cells have a single large cytoplasmic inclusion of bright pink
hyaline material. Most cells contain a single round to oval nucleus, although scattered
binucleated cells with nuclear molding were also present. Some cells contain small but
prominent nucleoli. The nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio is high but markedly variable.
Anisocytosis and anisokaryosis were marked. The diagnosis was transitional cell carcinoma.
Sherpa was treated with chemotherapy.
