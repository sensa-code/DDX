bilirubinemia and elevated liver enzymes. This syndrome may occasionally mimic a cholestatic
process (Meyer). Because of the steroid leukogram and history of chronic illness,
corticosteroid effects on the liver could also contribute to increases in ALP and GGT, as well
as AST and ALT (see below).


Increased AST with normal ALT: ALT is more specific for hepatocellular damage than AST,
however AST is more sensitive. Many tissues contain AST, limiting the usefulness of this test
for the diagnosis of liver disease, however some degree of hepatocellular damage secondary
to the toxic effects of bile in cholestatic conditions is common. A normal creatine kinase
could help rule out muscle as a source for elevated serum AST. As discussed for Quasi (Case
15-pancreatitis) and Nutmeg (Case 16-pancreatitis and hepatitis), extension of the
inflammatory process from the pancreas to the liver can cause hepatocellular enzyme
elevations in patients with pancreatitis.


Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia: Once post-prandial effects are ruled out,
endocrinopathies (hypothyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism, diabetes mellitus) and liver or
pancreatic diseases are common causes of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia.
Hyperlipidemia may contribute to the development of pancreatitis or may be a consequence
of pancreatitis. In some cases, multiple causes of hyperlipidemia can be present. For example,
one study of 221 canine diabetics found that 23% had concurrent hyperadrenocorticism, 13%
had acute pancreatitis, and 4% were hypothyroid (Hess 2000). Idiopathic hyperlipidemias are
described but much less common than secondary causes. Lipoprotein lipase is an enzyme
present on the vascular endothelium which hydrolyzes triglycerides into fatty acids and
monoglycerides. Insulin enhances this function, therefore insulin deficiency leads to
accumulation of triglycerides in the circulation. Insulin deficiency also leads to enhanced
lipolysis, with resultant release of free fatty acids into the circulation which will eventually be
processed by the liver into more triglycerides and ketone bodies (Kerl). Typically, ketone
bodies are utilized as an energy source as they are produced unless stress hormones such as
glucagon, epinephrine or cortisol further promote ketogenesis by hepatic mitochondria.
Epinephrine and cortisol will contribute to this process by stimulating muscle protein
degradation to supply amino acids for the production of ketone bodies. This is one mechanism
by which a stressful event or illness can trigger diabetic ketoacidosis. Increases in serum
triglycerides may be greater in magnitude than the hypercholesterolemia in diabetic patients.
Even when pathologic processes cause hypercholesterolemia in dogs, there are rarely
physiologic consequences because the proportion of low density lipoproteins remain low
(Bauer). Occasional ocular abnormalities and rare cases of atherosclerosis have been described.


Hyperamylasemia: The increase in serum amylase in this patient could be explained by
decreased glomerular filtration rate, however there is no evidence of azotemia. Both intestinal
and pancreatic pathology can elevate serum amylase. Imaging studies or additional tests may
be helpful to support a diagnosis of pancreatitis. (See Jimbo-Case 22, Quasi-Case 15).


Urinalysis: The specific gravity may be appropriate depending on the hydration status of the
patient since there is no evidence of azotemia. Some amount of osmotic diuresis is expected
to accompany the glucosuria and ketonuria. The presence of these osmoles may minimally
increase the urine specific gravity if present in very large quantities. It appears that the
ketones Amaryllis is generating are being utilized or eliminated in the urine rather than
accumulating in the blood since she has a normal HCO3, serum chloride, and anion gap.
Urine collected by cystocentesis may have a variable amount of blood contamination, which
could introduce small amounts of protein, heme, red blood cells, and white blood cells.
Although no bacteria are noted, urine culture is still recommended in diabetic patients with
clinical signs compatible with urinary tract infection because of the increased incidence of
occult infections (McGuire).


###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Based on the laboratory work, Amaryllis was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus with ketosis
(but not yet ketoacidosis). Pancreatitis was also considered likely based on laboratory work
and imaging studies. She was treated with intravenous fluids, antibiotics and regular insulin.
Over several days, Amaryllis was offered small amounts of bland food and water, but her
appetite remained poor. The hyperbilirubinemia improved, suggesting improvement in her
pancreatitis, however persistent changes in the region of the pancreas were noted on repeat
abdominal ultrasound. Amaryllis was discharged on fluids and insulin with home-monitoring
of urine for glucose and ketones. Changes in the liver parameters were interpreted to be
secondary to diabetes and pancreatitis, so no liver biopsy was performed.


As alluded to above, there are complex relationships between multiple endocrinopathies,
liver disease, pancreatic disease, and hyperlipidemia. The presence of one of the
abnormalities certainly does not rule out the presence of another, and in fact, they may occur
together with some frequency. Hyperadrenocorticism can cause both a steroid hepatopathy
and insulin resistance resembling or exacerbating diabetes mellitus. Acute necrotizing
pancreatitis can destroy beta cell islets, causing transient or permanent diabetes mellitus.
Conversely, hyperlipidemia may be a predisposing factor for pancreatitis. It may be necessary
to prioritize for treatment the most severe problems based on clinical history and laboratory
abnormalities (in this case diabetes with ketosis). After these are under control, re-assess the
patient to determine if secondary problems resolved with initial treatment or if there are
multiple primary problems. Sometimes, this can be a prolonged process. For example, it is
necessary to control diabetes mellitus to accurately test for hyperadrenocorticism, however
hyperadrenocorticism causes insulin resistance and intereferes with treatment for diabetes.
It is useful to compare Amaryllis with Marion (Case 7) who had diabetes without confirmed
pancreatic or hepatobiliary disease. Liver enzyme changes were similar in both patients,
although Amaryllis has hyperbilirubinemia, making it more likely that her liver enzyme
elevations indicate the potential for significant hepatic pathology and may not just be
occurring secondary to the diabetes or corticosteroid effects. Quasi (Case 15), the dog with
pancreatitis, also had hepatocellular enzyme elevations, however measurement of cholestatic
enzymes and bilirubin was not possible due to interference secondary to hemolysis. The dog
with histologically confirmed pancreatitis and cholangiohepatitis (Nutmeg-Case 16) had
elevations in all liver enzymes and hyperbilirubinemia of a degree similar to Amaryllis. Like
Nutmeg, it is possible that once the pancreatitis begins to resolve, secondary cholestasis
would be relieved and liver enzyme abnormalities and hyperbilirubinemia would improve in
subsequent biochemical panels in Amaryllis.

GI Case 20 – Level 3
“Hooligan” is a 17-year old-spayed female domestic short haired cat presenting for increased
drinking and decreased appetite for the past 2 days. Hooligan was diagnosed with diabetes
mellitus 2 years ago, and is currently taking glipizide. No bloodwork has been performed for
one year. She occasionally gets urinary tract infections, which are characterized by frequent
urinations and usually resolve with antibiotic therapy. On physical examination, Hooligan is
dehydrated with increased skin turgor and tacky mucous membranes. She has moderate
dental tartar and hepatomegaly.

###### **Interpretation**

No CBC data is available on this patient


Hyperglycemia: Given the history, the most likely cause for the hyperglycemia and glucosuria
is diabetes mellitus, although stress could exacerbate the hyperglycemia. The clinical signs
suggest poor control at this point, however serum fructosamine (See Marmalade-Case 2)
could be measured as a longer term indicator of serum glucose levels.


Azotemia:
Azotemia should be categorized as pre-renal, renal, or post-renal. There is no clinical
evidence of urinary obstruction in this patient, therefore prerenal and renal components
should be considered. Hooligan is clinically dehydrated, so at least a portion of the azotemia
is likely pre-renal. Given the degree of dehydration, the urine is less than optimally
concentrated and suggests some renal impairment. It can be difficult to adequately gauge
renal function in poorly controlled diabetic patients. The glucose in the urine will cause some
degree of osmotic diuresis, decreasing urine specific gravity. At the same time, the presence
of glucose in the urine will increase the specific gravity by approximately 0.001 for every 270
mg/dl of glucose.


Hyperphosphatemia: The most likely cause of hyperphosphatemia in this patient is
decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), regardless of whether the decreased GFR is due
to primary renal insufficiency or is pre-renal in origin.


Hyperproteinemia with hyperalbuminemia: Because overproduction of albumin does not
typically occur, hyperalbuminemia is the result of hemoconcentration. This is compatible with
Hooligan’s dehydrated state.


Decreased HCO3: The decreased HCO3 indicates acidosis. In this case, lactic acidosis due to
decreased tissue perfusion secondary to dehydration and uremic acidosis are potential
contributors. The absence of urine ketones suggests that ketoacidosis is not a major cause of
metabolic acidosis at this time. (Please see Chapter 7 for more complete discussion).
Hooligan is certainly at risk for developing ketoacidosis because of anorexia and concurrent
disease (possible urinary tract infection, likely renal failure).


Mild increases in ALT and AST: As noted in Chapter 2 on liver enzymes, there are numerous
extrahepatic processes that can elevate serum liver enzymes in the absence of primary
hepatic pathology. Several endocrinopathies, including diabetes mellitus, may cause these
abnormalities in the cat. Significant liver disease is less likely in this cat, because most causes
of primary hepatic disease in cats are characterized by hyperbilirubinemia in addition to
increased liver enzyme activities. Hyperthyroidism is another serious consideration in an
elderly cat with elevated liver enzymes, hyperglycemia, and weight loss. The presence of
diabetes mellitus in this patient in no way rules out hyperthyroidism.


Mild hyperamylasemia: Amylase is a very poor test for pancreatitis in the cat. Although
pancreatitis cannot be ruled out in Hooligan’s case, decreased glomerular filtration is the
probable cause for the hyperamylasemia.


Urinalysis: Glucosuria is expected in any patient whose blood glucose concentration exceeds
approximately 200 mg/dl, which is the renal threshold for reabsorption. Other abnormalities
such as the active sediment, proteinuria, and 2+ heme could be compatible with urinary tract
inflammation, especially considering Hooligan’s history of urinary tract infections. Diabetic
patients are predisposed to urinary tract infections because glucose can provide a substrate
for bacterial growth and because of subtle but relatively consistent immune function defects.
Bacterial culture and sensitivity testing is recommended for appropriate therapy of this
patient. Because renal disease is suspected, urinalysis should be repeated after improved
management of the diabetes and treatment of any urinary tract infections. Persistent
proteinuria could reflect glomerular protein loss, and should be followed up by a urine
protein:creatinine ratio. The history of repeated urinary tract infections suggests that
pyelonephritis could be a potential cause for renal failure, however chronic renal disease is a
common problem in geriatric cats with no such history.


###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Intravenous fluid therapy and imaging studies of the urinary tract were strongly
recommended, however the owner declined therapy and took Hooligan home. Amoxicillin
and subcutaneous fluids were administered at home. The case was lost to follow-up.


Hooligan’s case illustrates how multiple concurrent diseases and laboratory abnormalities can
complicate interpretation of diagnostic tests. In some cases, the correct interpretation of
some laboratory data can only be certain after treatment has begun. For example, the
degree of renal versus prerenal azotemia cannot be determined until the patient is
appropriately hydrated. Furthermore, the true renal concentrating ability may not be clear
until glucosuria and the resultant osmotic diuresis is corrected. Although the previous two
cases of diabetes mellitus were not azotemic (Marion-Case 18 and Amaryllis-Case 19),
patients with diabetes mellitus can present with prerenal azotemia and impaired urinary
concentrating ability due to osmotic diuresis in the absence of irreversible renal failure.
