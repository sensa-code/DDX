Mildly increased ALP and ALT: There are many potential causes for increased ALP in the
dog, including medications, corticosteroid effects, endocrinopathies and cholestatic disease
(please see Chapter 2 for a more complete list of differential diagnoses for increased ALP
and ALT). In this case, endocrinopathy is the most likely cause. Because of derangements in
glucose homeostasis that are present in diabetes mellitus, lipid accumulates within the
hepatocytes. This can lead to mild cholestasis and increased ALP. Similarly, hepatocellular
enzymes may also increase with diabetes mellitus. While hepatocellular pathologic changes
are usually mild, occasional diabetics will also have increased bile acids, suggesting
decreased liver function.


Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia: In poorly controlled insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus, there is a rapid mobilization of triglycerides, which increases plasma levels of
free fatty acids for use as an energy source by numerous tissues except the brain. Deficiency of
insulin leads to decreased activation of lipoprotein lipase, so fatty acids cannot be taken up
from the circulation for storage in adipose tissue. In addition, down regulation of low density
lipoprotein receptors in the absence of insulin results in hypercholesterolemia. Post-prandial
hyperlipidemia, pancreatic or liver disease, and other endocrinopathies such as hyperadrenocorticism or hypothyroidism may also cause abnormalities of cholesterol and triglycerides.


Urinalysis: The urine is somewhat concentrated despite significant glucosuria. Once blood
glucose levels exceed the renal tubular maximum for reabsorption (approximately 200 mg/dl
in the dog), glucosuria will occur, although glucosuria may be seen in patients that are
normoglycemic if there is tubular dysfunction. Glucosuria and proteinuria may falsely increase
the urine specific gravity slightly (an increase in specific gravity of 0.001 per 400 mg
protein/dl or per 270 mg glucose/dl). Proteinuria is present, and may be the result of urinary
tract infection, as indicated by the active sediment and presence of bacteria. It should be
noted that not all diabetic patients with urinary tract infection will have active sediment,
possibly due to neutrophil function defects that have been described in these patients.
Proteinuria may also occur as a result of glomerular damage secondary to diabetes or the
hypertension that may accompany diabetes.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Marion was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus based on clinical signs and laboratory
abnormalities. She was not ketotic at the time of presentation, and responded well to insulin
therapy. She also was treated with antibiotics for her urinary tract infection.


In contrast to Marmalade (Case 2), the cat with stress induced hyperglycemia, Marion has
marked rather than moderate hyperglycemia, and she clinical signs compatible with diabetes
mellitus. Other supportive laboratory abnormalities such as glucosuria, hypercholesterolemia,
and hypertriglyceridemia are present in Marion but absent in Marmalade. The classification
system of diabetes in people as insulin dependent or non-insulin dependent has been
applied to domestic species. Dogs are most often insulin dependent, while cats may be


either and can actually fluctuate over time in their requirement for insulin. If the insulin
deficiency is sufficiently severe, or if concurrent diseases increase diabetogenic hormones
such as catecholamines or corticosteroids, ketoacidosis may develop.


Other differential diagnoses for Marion include hyperadrenocorticism, which shares many clinical
and laboratory features with diabetes mellitus. Because screening tests for hyperadrenocortism
are often abnormal in patients with newly diagnosed or poorly controlled diabetes, these tests
should be reserved for patients with classical clinical signs of hyperadrenocorticism (bilaterally
symmetric hair loss, calcinosis cutis, adrenomegaly) and patients who have evidence of insulin
resistance. Because Marion was easily regulated and did not have other suggestive clinical signs
that could not be explained by diabetes, concurrent hyperadrenocorticism was considered
unlikely.


Long term monitoring of diabetic patients is required. Although 24 hour glucose curves were
once standard methods of monitoring the progress of diabetic patients, these are expensive
and stressful for the patient. Results may be misleading because of stress induced increases
in blood glucose levels and the reluctance of some patients to eat in the hospital. This is
particularly true for feline patients. An attractive alternative is measurement of serum
fructosamine levels, which reflect glycemic control over several weeks and can help
differentiate stress induced hyperglycemia from diabetes (see Marmalade). Glycated
hemoglobin levels are also helpful, however these species specific assays are less widely
available to the practitioner.


Once diagnosed, a variety of approaches for home monitoring of blood glucose and
glycemic control have been advocated that vary in reliance on clinical signs and/or direct
monitoring of blood glucose or glucosuria (Nelson, Briggs). Hand held point of care
instruments are particularly successful in diabetic dogs. With proper supervision by veterinary
staff, this allows more frequent and less expensive monitoring of patients (Casella, Reusch).
Ultimately, the practitioner must balance the costs and benefits of clinical and laboratory
evaluation of diabetic patients in the context of each individual case.

GI Case 19 – Level 3
Amaryllis is a 7-year-old spayed female Doberman Pinscher mixed breed dog presenting for a
20 pound weight loss over the past year attributed to decreased consumption of table food.
Over the past month, Amaryllis has been lethargic and anorexic, associated with intermittent
vomiting and diarrhea. Her previous history includes an asymptomatic heart murmur. On
physical examination, Amaryllis was thin and depressed but alert and responsive. The
presence of a left-sided systolic heart murmur was confirmed. She had a tight, distended
abdomen, but she was not painful on abdominal palpation. Abdominal ultrasound showed an
enlarged hyperechoic liver, changes in the region of the pancreas compatible with pancreatitis,
and mild abdominal effusion. Thoracic radiographs were suggestive of pneumonia.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: Amaryllis has a barely perceptible neutrophilia, which in combination with the
toxic change supports mild inflammation. Potential sources include pneumonia, pancreatitis,
or a urinary tract infection. Although only small numbers of leukocytes and no bacteria were
seen, a culture is recommended as urinary tract infections are common in patients with
diabetes and they may be occult (Forrester, McGuire). The lymphopenia is likely associated
with endogeneous corticosteroids from a protracted illness.


Erythrogram: The erythrogram of this patient is normal, therefore hemolysis can be ruled out
as a cause for the icteric plasma. Elevated liver enzymes are compatible with cholestasis as a
cause for the hyperbilirubinemia.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: There are numerous possible causes of hyperglycemia. During an initial
evaluation, post-prandial effects or the possibility of either transient corticosteroid or
epinephrine induced elevations should be ruled out. Given the history of weight loss and the
presence of significant amounts of glucose and ketones in the urine, diabetes mellitus should
be considered a primary differential diagnosis. Whenever blood glucose levels exceed
approximately 200 mg/dl, the renal tubular maximum for glucose reabsorption can be
exceeded, resulting in glucosuria, regardless of the cause of the hyperglycemia. Glucosuria
itself does not rule out stress-induced hyperglycemia, however ketonuria is strongly
suggestive for diabetes. Confirmation of a diagnosis of diabetes by measuring serum
fructosamine levels could be considered, but is probably not necessary for Amaryllis. Any
cause of insulin resistance such as hyperadrenocorticism must also be considered. Amaryllis
has a mild neutrophilic leukocytosis and lymphopenia, compatible with a corticosteroid
effect. Pancreatitis can be associated with hyperglycemia, either due to stress secondary to
pain or due diabetes mellitus. Pancreatitis-induced diabetes may be transient or permanent,
depending on the severity of pancreatic damage.


Mild hypophosphatemia and hypocalcemia: Neither of these values is likely to be physiologically significant. The hypocalcemia may be related to the low serum albumin and is
unlikely to be associated with a decrease in biologically active ionized calcium. Hypocalcemia
has been described in dogs with acute pancreatitis, but it does not appear to be as common
as in humans (Hess 1998). Both total and ionized calcium levels may be low in cats with acute


pancreatitis. Possible mechanisms for low ionized calcium in animals with pancreatitis include
deposition in saponified tissues, glucagon-mediated increases in calcitonin concentration,
and decreased parathyroid hormone activity secondary to hypomagnesemia.
Hypophosphatemia can result in lethargy, depression, and diarrhea. Hemolytic anemia can
occur if the phosphorus drops below 1 mg/dl. Treatment of diabetic patients with insulin can
promote a rapid translocation of phosphorus into cells, associated with a precipitous and
potentially dangerous decline in serum phosphorus. Acidemia is associated with a cellular
translocation from the intracellular to the extracellular space, therefore correction of
acid/base disturbances in ketotic patients can further depress the serum phophorus
concentration.


Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia and low normal globulins: Considerations for
hypoalbuminemia include decreased production secondary to starvation, liver failure, or a
negative acute phase response. The weight loss in this patient is dramatic, and starvation
may be an issue if the body condition score is very low, however transient anorexia does not
typically lower serum albumin. Liver enzyme elevations are compatible with liver disease,
however other analytes that may decrease with impaired liver function (blood urea nitrogen,
glucose, and cholesterol) are normal to increased. None of these values are sensitive or
specific tests of liver function, and other more specific tests should be performed to evaluate
this possibility. Toxic change in neutrophils indicates some inflammation, however increased
production of positive acute phase reactants should induce hyperglobulinemia, which is not
present at this time. Increased loss of albumin can also cause hypoalbuminemia.
Gastrointestinal, cutaneous, and third space losses should be considered, and the abdominal
effusion may be a source of protein loss. Isolated loss of albumin is most likely with
glomerular lesions. The urinalysis in this case reveals mild proteinuria; a urine
protein:creatinine ratio would be helpful in determining the severity of the proteinuria.
Because leukocytes and erythrocytes are present in the urine sediment and diabetic patients
are at risk for urinary tract infections, the possibility that proteinuria is due to lower urinary
tract disease should be ruled out prior to pursuing a diagnosis of glomerular disease.


Hypokalemia: Anorexia can contribute to hypokalemia because of decreased intake of
potassium, however it is usually only clinically significant in combination with increased losses.
Amaryllis could be losing potassium through her gastrointestinal tract since there is a history
of vomiting and diarrhea, or she may be losing it into the abdominal effusion. Renal
potassium wastage is associated with osmotic diuresis from glucosuria and ketonuria. While
acidemia is often cited as contributing to hypokalemia by causing a shift of potassium into
cells, some authors conclude that these shifts are transient and less significant with organic
acidosis like ketoacidosis than for mineral acidosis. Although serum potassium levels are not
good indicators of total body potassium stores, the history of polyuria and gastrointestinal
signs in this patient puts her at risk for potassium depletion. As discussed above in regards to
phosphorus, treatment with insulin is expected to cause translocation of potassium into cells
that could further depress serum potassium.


Hyperbilirubinemia with increased ALP and GGT: This combination of data is compatible
with cholestasis, especially since the hematocrit is within normal limits, making hemolysis
unlikely. Serum ALP activity can increase with a variety of endocrinopathies, including
diabetes mellitus, however the concurrent hyperbilirubinemia and increased GGT suggests
that diabetes alone is unlikely to be the cause of the elevated ALP. Pancreatitis may be the
cause of the cholestasis based on the ultrasound study and hyperamylasemia. Although
evidence of sepsis in this patient is weak, extrahepatic bacterial infections can result in hyper

bilirubinemia and elevated liver enzymes. This syndrome may occasionally mimic a cholestatic
process (Meyer). Because of the steroid leukogram and history of chronic illness,
corticosteroid effects on the liver could also contribute to increases in ALP and GGT, as well
as AST and ALT (see below).
