Hyponatremia with proportional hypochloremia: These are mild changes of questionable
clinical significance, but are likely present because of electrolyte losses into the thoracic effusion.


Hyperbilirubinemia: Sepsis, liver disease, and hemolysis may all be factors in causing June’s
hyperbilirubinemia. Significant cholestatic liver disease is ruled out based on the normal ALP
and GGT. Hemolytic anemias are typically regenerative given sufficient time, and June’s anemia
is non-regenerative at presentation, making this less likely than sepsis and liver disease as causes
for this abnormality.


Increased ALT and AST:
Increased ALT suggests hepatocellular damage, which may be related to hypoxia (anemia and
respiratory difficulty), sepsis, or hypoperfusion related to shock. Since the increase in AST is
greater than the elevation in ALT, some of the increase in this enzyme may be related to muscle
damage from the same causes. No CK is available to confirm this impression.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Further testing performed while June was hospitalized revealed the presence of feline leukemia
virus (FeLV) antigen. She was feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) negative. Despite June’s
condition at presentation and FeLV status, she responded well to treatment and was discharged
6 days after presentation on oral antibiotics. She was re-evaluated 6 weeks later. At that time her
lungs were clear and she had gained some weight, but had some residual upper airway stridor.
All of her laboratory abnormalities were resolved except for a persistent non-regenerative
anemia. Bone marrow evaluation demonstrated erythroid hypoplasia, but myeloid and
megakaryocytic activity was normal and there was no evidence of dysplasia in the erythroid line.
The suppression of red blood cell production was assumed to be related to June’s FeLV status.


This case is similar to Susannah (Case 7), in which poor body condition, severe inflammatory
disease, and cavity effusion combine to influence serum protein data. In both cases, the
globulin levels are within reference intervals despite the expected increases in acute phase
reactants and/or immunoglobulins. This may reflect concurrent protein losses, however note
that the reference interval is much greater for albumin than globulin, indicating greater
biological variability under “normal” circumstances.


Case 12 – Level 3
“Ellis” is an 11-month-old neutered male Labrador Retriever who presented having collapsed
acutely after a run. He had profuse diarrhea in the car on the way to the hospital. On physical
examination, Ellis is depressed and unresponsive, and his mucous membranes are bright red.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: On Day 1, Ellis is leukopenic due to neutropenia with no evidence of a left shift or toxic
change. This may be due to acute margination of granulocytes, or consumption in an acute,
overwhelming inflammatory process. The thrombocytopenia could also be due to increased
peripheral consumption associated with vascular pathology or immune mediated destruction.
The polycythemia is likely related to dehydration, as supported by the increased serum
albumin. Normoblastemia (increased nRBCs) could be compatible with a regenerative
response or a primary hematopoietic disorder. There is no evidence of regeneration at this
time (no polychromasia). Increased numbers of nucleated erythrocytes can be present in the
circulation associated with endothelial damage of any cause, including sepsis, shock,
hyperthermia, neoplasia, or any potential cause of hypoxia or hypoglycemia. Given the
neutropenia in combination with the thrombocytopenia and metarubricytosis, a marrow
disorder leading to depressed production of cells is possible. If peripheral processes cannot
account for the hematologic changes, a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are indicated.
Coagulation status appears normal at presentation.


By Day 2, neutrophil numbers have normalized, however there is a minor increase in bands
and some toxic change, supporting inflammation. The thrombocytopenia is severe by this
time. Ellis is at risk for spontaneous bleeding and should be monitored carefully. The
apparent response in the granulocyte line makes a primary bone marrow disorder less likely,
and peripheral consumption is suspected. In contrast to the previous polycythemia, Ellis is
now mildly anemic with a mild macrocytosis that could be explained by incipient
regeneration. Fluid therapy decreased the red cell numbers, however concurrent blood loss
is also likely given the anemia and hypoproteinemia.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Glucose: On day 1, the serum glucose is at the lower end of the reference range, which is
compatible with sepsis (see leukogram data), however on day 2, there is mild hyperglycemia
that could be nonspecifically related to stress, illness, or to administration of glucose
containing fluids.


Increased creatinine with high normal BUN: On day 1, the polycythemia and hyperalbuminemia suggest that Ellis is dehydrated, compatible with some degree of pre-renal
azotemia. The urine is close to the isosthenuric range despite the dehydration, suggesting
compromised renal function. Glucosuria indicates the potential for osmotic diuresis.
Glucosuria in association with low normal blood glucose levels is evidence of renal tubular
dysfunction if the urine sample does not contain contaminants that could cause a false
positive reaction on the test strip. Urinalysis should be repeated to determine if there was
transient renal dysfunction related to an acute event or if longer term compromise in renal
function is likely.


Hypercalcemia with normal phosphorus: Generally, one of the primary differential diagnoses
for hypercalcemia is neoplasia, however Ellis is a young dog and is unlikely to have a
malignant process. Growing large breed dogs may have slightly elevated calcium associated
with bone growth, however the hypercalcemia in this case is most likely because of increased
protein bound calcium associated with hyperproteinemia. This interpretation is supported by
normalization of the serum calcium as the albumin in the serum drops by Day 2.


Hypomagnesemia: Hypomagnesemia on Day 2 could be related to gastrointestinal losses
associated with the diarrhea or to low serum protein. Like calcium, a proportion of serum
magnesium is protein bound.


Hyperproteinemia with increased serum albumin on Day 1, then mild panhypoproteinemia
on day 2: Because the liver does not overproduce albumin, increased serum albumin is
evidence of dehydration. The dramatic change on the following day reflects correction of fluid
deficits as well as some type of non-selective protein loss. The thrombocytopenia indicates risk
for hemorrhage, which should be evaluated clinically. Gastrointestinal blood or protein loss is
less easily documented than other types, but the presence of diarrhea suggests the potential
for gastrointestinal lesions. The thrombocytopenia and metarubricytosis are compatible with
endothelial damage, which could increase vascular permeability and allow loss of protein into
the interstitial space. Proteinuria is present and can be quantified by measuring a urine
protein:creatinine ratio. Because pyuria is also noted on the sediment examination, urinary
tract inflammation rather than selective glomerular loss of albumin should be ruled out first.
Urine culture is recommended to document any treatable infectious causes for the pyuria and
proteinuria.


Acidemia (low HCO3) with increased anion gap: These abnormalities indicate a metabolic
acidosis with increased unmeasured anions. Dehydration and collapse suggest the potential
for lactic acidosis from decreased perfusion of tissues, while the azotemia could be
compatible with uremic acidosis as well. Acid/base status normalizes by Day 2.


Mild hyperbilirubinemia: Potential causes of hyperbilirubinemia in this case include sepsis
(neutropenia, low normal blood glucose), decreased liver function (not specifically evaluated
by serum bile acid or blood ammonia measurement), cholestasis (increased ALP), or
hemolysis (less likely because the bilirubin is high when Ellis is polycythemic, but normal by
the time his anemia develops). Whatever the cause, the hyperbilirubinemia is minimal and
transient, and unlikely to be clinically significant.


Increased ALP: There are numerous potential hepatic and extrehepatic causes of elevated
ALP in the dog. Young large breed dogs may have elevated ALP because of bone growth. A
complete medication history should be taken to rule out the influence of medications,
particularly anti-convulsants, corticosteroids, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Various
endocrinopathies and metabolic disorders can increased ALP, but are uncommon in young
dogs. In the context of the clinical history and other elevated liver enzymes, some degree of
hepatic damage is likely, and the increased ALP could suggest a cholestatic component.


Increased ALT and AST: These enzyme changes indicate hepatocellular damage, possibly in
combination with some muscle damage, however a CK is not available to corroborate that
interpretation. Decreased perfusion associated with shock is likely to be a factor in this
patient; sepsis is another possibility. The potential for trauma such as being hit by a car
should also be evaluated. Primary liver disease cannot be ruled out, but this is less likely in a
young dog and secondary causes are suggested by the history. A liver biopsy is not indicated
at this time.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Ellis was treated with plasma, fluids, and broad spectrum antibiotics. His history, clinical signs,
and laboratory data were compatible with heat stroke. The hematologic abnormalities largely
reflect thermal endothelial damage compounded by hypovolemia, shock, and possible
bacteremia/endotoxemia from translocation of gut organisms through compromised bowel.
Changes in the clinical chemistry profile also largely reflect the same processes, however
acute renal compromise and liver damage can be the results of hemodynamic instability and
thermal injury to renal tubular cells and hepatocytes. This case may be compared with Sally
(Chapter 5, Case 14), who suffered from more severe heat stroke. While Ellis responded well
to management, Sally progressed to renal failure secondary to her episode.


Ellis is a good example of how rapidly shifts in fluid and protein can occur. At presentation,
losses of fluid in excess of protein loss cause hyperproteinemia, but just 24 hours later, fluid
therapy and on-going protein loss result in panhypoproteinemia. Similar changes are noted in
the hematocrit.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: The lymphopenia may be related to corticosteroid effects from stress or may be due to
an immature immune system.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: This foal is predisposed to sepsis due to immaturity and compromised ability
to nurse, so sepsis is a potential cause of hypoglycemia. Although starvation rarely results in
hypoglycemia in adult animals, neonates may be predisposed to hypoglycemia with
decreased food intake because of low fat stores and inadequate hepatic gluconeogenesis.


Normal BUN and increased creatinine: A urine specific gravity measurement would be
helpful in assessing the elevated creatinine. This foal could be dehydrated if it is unable to
nurse, however renal disease is possible.


Hypercalcemia: Hypercalcemia and high-normal phosphorus may be attributed to agerelated skeletal development, however renal failure in horses can be associated with
hypercalcemia (See Chapter 5, Case 9).


Hypomagnesemia: Low intake and increased gastrointestinal losses likely combine to cause
the hypomagnesemia.


Hypoproteinemia with normal albumin and hypoglobulinemia: Neonatal animals have
relatively higher total body water content, which may slightly depress serum protein levels. In
addition, young animals have relatively lower globulin levels because they have been
exposed to fewer antigens. In this case, the history suggests failure of transfer of passive


immunity due to inadequate intake of colostrum. Serum total globulin is not considered a
sensitive or specific test for failure of transfer of passive immunity, which should be evaluated
by a more specific test than quantitates IgG.
