GI Case 17 – Level 2
“Flame” is a 26-year-old Quarter Horse mare presenting for a six day history of decreased
feed intake, colic episodes, right forelimb lameness (previously diagnosed as rotation of the
coffin bone in that limb), and possible neurologic abnormalities. She had been seen rolling
and laying on her side in her stall along with aggressive pawing at the ground. She was
treated with Banamine [®] . She had been vaccinated for West Nile Virus. On presentation,
Flame was very lame on her right forelimb with sensitivity to pressure with hoof testers. She
was sweating and dehydrated with a normal body temperature. She had good appetite when
offered food, however gut sounds were not noted on either side.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: Flame has a mild leucopenia with lymphopenia. Causes of lymphopenia are
numerous, but some possibilities in this case include acute viral disease, endotoxemia,
rickettsial diseases and corticosteroid effects. Neutrophil numbers are approaching the lower
end of the reference interval and should be monitored. Endotoxemia and rickettsial diseases
may suppress neutrophil numbers and cause toxic change, while corticosteroids should result
in mild mature neutrophilia with no morphologic abnormalities. The fibrinogen is not
supportive of inflammation. The remainder of the CBC was unremarkable.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Elevations in serum glucose in the horse are most often caused by
excitement or stress with release of endogenous catecholamines and glucocorticoids,
respectively. In this case, this may be the result of pain from episodes of colic, described in
the patient’s history. A corticosteroid effect is supported by the concurrent lymphopenia.
Transient hyperglycemia can also be observed in the very acute phase of endotoxemia prior
to hypoglycemia. In an older horse like Flame, insulin resistance associated with hyperplasia
or tumor of the pituitary pars intermedia (Equine Cushing’s syndrome) can cause
hyperglycemia. Insulin-responsive diabetes mellitus is rare in domestic large animal species.


Hypocalcemia: Because a significant fraction of calcium in the blood is complexed to protein,
low serum albumin can result in low total serum calcium measurements. In this case, the
albumin is low, but not outside of the reference range. Total hypocalcemia associated with
hypoalbuminemia does not affect the biologically active ionized fraction, and so is not
associated with clinical signs. A recent study of 64 horses with enterocolitis showed that 75%
had low total serum calcium and 80% had low ionized calcium (Toribio). The mechanism was
unclear, but did not appear to be due to renal wasting as fractional excretion of calcium was
significantly lower in horses with colitis than healthy control horses. Serum intact parathyroid
concentrations (PTH) were normal to increased, suggesting a variable physiological response
to hypocalcemia. Studies in humans and laboratory animals indicate that sepsis and
inflammatory hormones can influence hormonal regulation of calcium by calcitonin and PTH.
In turn, hypomagnesemia can interfere with PTH secretion and alter the responsiveness of
target tissues to PTH stimulation. Primary hypoparathyroidism could cause hypocalcemia, but
is rare in horses. More likely, anorexia may also contribute to hypocalcemia in horses.


Hypomagnesemia:
Hypomagnesemia could be due to dietary deficiency, impaired gut absorption or increased
renal excretion. Because of the role of magnesium in calcium regulation, correction of low
serum magnesium levels may be sufficient to correct hypocalcemia.


Hyponatremia and hypochloremia with mildly increased anion gap: Because of the high
concentrations of triglycerides, measurement of electrolytes by ion specific electrode (ISE)
should be confirmed. Titrimetric methods will underestimate electrolytes in lipemic samples,
while colorimetric methods may overestimate them. Even ISE measurement can have
methodologic problems, if there is substantial dilution of lipemic samples with aqueous
diluent as part of the analytical procedure. Low serum sodium and chloride in this case are
attributable to increased gastrointestinal losses associated with colic, although significant
losses from sweating are also likely. When changes in serum chloride are proportional to
sodium, no further analysis is required. When the relative decrease in chloride appears to be
greater than sodium, considerations include pure gastric vomiting (not seen in horses),
sequestration of chloride containing fluids (more common in ruminants), or a compensatory
change in response to a primary respiratory acidosis. Because bicarbonate and chloride are
both anions, they tend to vary inversely, therefore hypochloremia is usually associated with
alkalemia. In this case the HCO3 is within the reference interval despite the hypochloremia,
consistent with a mixed acid/base disorder. Increased anion gap is most often associated with
elevations in unmeasured anions, many of which are acids.


Increased GGT: In an adult horse, increased GGT is evidence for liver damage and
cholestasis. This change is often associated with hyperbilirubinemia, although bilirubin can be
efficiently eliminated in the urine. ALP is less liver specific than GGT and may be less
sensitive in the horse.


Increased AST: This enzyme is present in multiple tissues and elevations can be difficult to
interpret. In Flame, the concurrent increase in GGT and the normal CK supports hepatic
rather than muscle origin for the increase in AST, although the shorter half life of CK could
influence interpretation.


Hypertriglyceridemia: Fasted horses with hypertriglyceridemia should be evaluated for
hyperlipemia/hyperlipidemia syndrome, which is often triggered by feed restriction or
anorexia during colic episodes (Mogg). The syndrome is caused by decreased feed intake
with subsequent fat mobilization and accumulation in the plasma and liver. Flame is more
appropriately categorized as hyperlipidemic because her plasma is clear despite the high
triglyceride concentration. Hyperlipemia is a more serious condition accompanied by
lactescent plasma, impaired hepatic function and the production of abnormal very low
density lipoproteins that have less apolipoprotein B-100 and more apolipoprotein B-48. This
substitution may allow greater triglyceride content (Pearson). Although the triglyceride levels
in this patient exceeded the 1,200 mg/dl associated with a poor prognosis in the paper
originally describing this condition (Mogg), absence of any clinical or laboratory evidence of
significant liver dysfunction associated with the hyperlipidemia improves the prognosis.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Flame was extremely painful on her right front limb and was very sensitive to pressure from
hoof testers. Relief of pain with an abaxial nerve block resulted in improved appetite, which
corrected the hyperlipidemia. Flame responded well to intravenous fluids and calcium
gluconate to correct the mineral and electrolyte imbalances from the colic. The neurologic
abnormalities noted on the history were not confirmed at presentation. Had they been
present they would have been an indication for blood ammonia or serum bile acid testing
because of the potential for equine hyperlipemia to impair liver function.


The lymphopenia and hyperglycemia may persist if there is pituitary pars intermedia
dysfunction, although blood work is often normal in these patients and diagnosis is based on
appropriate clinical signs (hirstuism, chronic or recurrent laminitis, polyuria and polydipsia,


sweating, and muscle wasting) and elevated endogenous plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)
levels (Couetil).

GI Case 18 – Level 2
“Marion” is a 13-year-old spayed female Beagle presenting with a history of recurrent signs
of urinary tract infection that are not responding to antibiotics. Upon questioning, the owner
says that Marion has been drinking more than usual too. Although it is difficult to notice
because Marion has always had indiscriminate eating habits, she does appear to have an
even more voracious appetite than usual lately. On physical examination, Marion is slightly
thin, but cheerful.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Marion has a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis with toxic change, leukopenia, and a
monocytosis. The toxic changes in the neutrophils are consistent with inflammation, although
the other elements of the leukogram are also compatible with a corticosteroid response. The
mild normocytic normochromic nonregenerative anemia is most compatible with anemia of
chronic disease.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Marked hyperglycemia: The magnitude of the hyperglycemia in combination with glucosuria
and the clinical signs is most suggestive of diabetes mellitus. However, other causes of
hyperglycemia should be ruled out. This patient has hypercholesterolemia and increased
triglycerides in addition to marked hyperglycemia. While post-prandial elevations are
possible, this degree of hyperglycemia would be unusual even if blood were collected just
after eating. Marion had been fasted over night when this sample was collected. Illness of
any kind may cause mild elevations in glucose by interfering with insulin action on peripheral
tissues. Increases in both endogenous and exogenous corticosteroids may cause significant
increases in serum glucose concentrations. This patient had not been treated with corticosteroids within the previous six months, however elevations of endogenous corticosteroid
levels cannot be ruled out at this time. Hyperadrenocorticism may cause polyuria and
polydipsia, hyperglycemia, and increases in ALP, cholesterol, and triglycerides.
Hyperadrenocorticism and diabetes mellitus can be present concurrently, complicating both
the interpretation of laboratory tests and the clinical management of the patient.


Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: In many cases, hyponatremia reflects a relative water
excess rather than total body depletion of sodium. In patients like Marion that have marked
hyperglycemia, the increase in free water is due to the osmotic force generated by the
excess glucose in the extracellular fluid. Serum sodium typically decreases by 1.5 mEq/L for
each 100 mg/dl increase in glucose concentration above the upper end of the reference
interval. Therefore in this case, we would expect serum sodium to decrease by approximately
7.5 mEq/L, which seems an appropriate degree in this case. Changes in sodium are often
accompanied by proportional alterations in chloride, as seen in this case. (Please see Chapter
7 for further discussion).


Hyperkalemia: The regulation of potassium balance is complex and involves total body
regulation as well as shifts between intracellular and extracellular compartments. For Marion,
the mild hyperkalemia is likely due to insulin deficiency. Insulin causes potassium to enter
cells, and inadequate amounts of insulin will impair this process. Acidosis may further
increase potassium levels in some diabetic patients, however the bicarbonate levels in this
patient are within the reference interval. (Please see Chapter 7 for further discussion). Failure
of renal elimination can be important, but this is unlikely to be a major mechanism in this
case. Hyperkalemia is rarely due to increased intake, although excessive supplementation of
fluids can be an issue.


Mildly increased ALP and ALT: There are many potential causes for increased ALP in the
dog, including medications, corticosteroid effects, endocrinopathies and cholestatic disease
(please see Chapter 2 for a more complete list of differential diagnoses for increased ALP
and ALT). In this case, endocrinopathy is the most likely cause. Because of derangements in
glucose homeostasis that are present in diabetes mellitus, lipid accumulates within the
hepatocytes. This can lead to mild cholestasis and increased ALP. Similarly, hepatocellular
enzymes may also increase with diabetes mellitus. While hepatocellular pathologic changes
are usually mild, occasional diabetics will also have increased bile acids, suggesting
decreased liver function.
