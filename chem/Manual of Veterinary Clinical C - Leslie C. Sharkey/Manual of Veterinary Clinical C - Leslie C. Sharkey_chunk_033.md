Hypomagnesemia: Low intake and increased gastrointestinal losses likely combine to cause
the hypomagnesemia.


Hypoproteinemia with normal albumin and hypoglobulinemia: Neonatal animals have
relatively higher total body water content, which may slightly depress serum protein levels. In
addition, young animals have relatively lower globulin levels because they have been
exposed to fewer antigens. In this case, the history suggests failure of transfer of passive


immunity due to inadequate intake of colostrum. Serum total globulin is not considered a
sensitive or specific test for failure of transfer of passive immunity, which should be evaluated
by a more specific test than quantitates IgG.


Normal sodium with hypochloremia and increased HCO3: This foal has a hypochloremic
metabolic alkalosis, however hypochloremia may also reflect a response to a respiratory
acidosis. Various gastrointestinal problems may cause a metabolic alkalosis, as could
excessive supplementation with bicarbonate. With the complex history and potential for
respiratory compromise, blood gas analysis is strongly recommended to fully characterize the
acid/base status.


Low anion gap: Hypoproteinemia can cause a mildly decreased anion gap because proteins
are unmeasured anions.


Hyperbilirubinemia: In horses, anorexia should always be considered as a cause of hyperbilirubinemia. Sepsis is also possible in this case. Neonatal foal referance intervals are higher
than adults; this value may be normal for this age foal.


Increased ALP and GGT: The increased ALP is at least in part due to bone development,
however the concurrent increase in GGT could be compatible with hepatic pathology.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Sara was treated with oxygen, intravenous fluids, and plasma. A nasogastric tube was placed
for nutritional support. Although she remained recumbent, Sara appeared to respond well
initially. She had a good suckle reflex and would intermittently attempt to rise. Unfortunately,
she suffered a cardiac arrest the next day. Necropsy revealed mild atelectasis with a scant
amount of intra-alveolar meconium that indicated intrauterine stress or hypoxia. Interestingly,
the liver was characterized by moderate multifocal portal bridging with immature fibrous
connective tissue, oval cell hyperplasia with histiocytosis, and intrahepatic cholestasis
compatible with congenital biliary dysplasia. This is an unusual lesion that accounts for the
elevated GGT and possible some of the elevations in ALP and bilirubin, but is unlikely to
have contributed to the death of the patient. The etiology of the lesion was unclear.


Case 14 – Level 3
“Cha-Cha” is a 4-year-old Throughbred stallion that presented for surgical correction of left
laryngeal hemiplegia by laryngoplasty. Presurgical CBC and serum biochemical profile were
unremarkable. The surgery and initial recovery period were uneventful, however Cha-Cha did
not eat well during this time. About a week after surgery, Cha-Cha developed distal limb
edema. He presented again 2 weeks after surgery and was lethargic and dehydrated with
bright red mucous membranes. On physical examination, Cha-Cha has upper airway edema,
an elevated heart rate, and a distended abdomen. He has recently had soft manure, but now
has profuse watery diarrhea. A tracheostomy was performed to relieve upper airway distress.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: The leucopenia and neutropenia with toxic changes are compatible with severe acute
inflammation or endotoxemia. The clinical history of dehydration suggests that the
polycythemia is relative and will likely decrease when fluid deficits are corrected. The
combination of the neutropenia and thrombocytopenia could be compatible with a primary
marrow problem, however since these changes can be explained by sepsis, bone marrow
evaluation is not indicated at this time.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Mildly increased BUN: This is compatible with dehydration and pre-renal azotemia, however
sepsis may also increase the BUN. A urine specific gravity should be performed to ensure
adequate urinary concentrating ability and rule out renal failure.


Hypocalcemia: Low total calcium in this case is attributed to hypoalbuminemia.


Hypomagnesemia: Low intake is the likely cause of the hypomagnesemia.


Panhypoproteinemia: Both globulins and albumin are low, suggesting non-specific protein
losses, however the albumin is proportionally lower. This may be because the causes for


hypoalbuminemia are more severe or prolonged, or because the globulin protein levels are
proportionally increased due to increased production of acute phase reactants or
immunoglobulins associated with inflammation. A combination of factors could cause hypoalbuminemia in this horse. While Cha-Cha has not been eating well lately, starvation must be
advanced before it causes hypoalbuminemia. Serum albumin is a storage pool of protein,
which may be depleted after surgery or trauma. Decreased hepatic production of albumin is
possible given the elevated liver enzymes, however these are not adequate liver function
tests (See Chapter 2) and the absence of a pre-surgical history of liver enzyme elevations or
signs of liver disease makes this less likely. A severe, acute, diffuse liver insult cannot be ruled
out though. There may be a physiologic decrease in albumin production by the liver since
Cha-Cha has inflammatory disease and albumin is a negative acute phase reactant.
Nonspecific protein losses that could result in hypoalbuminemia and hypoglobulinemia
include gastrointestinal lesions and interstitial displacement of protein. Both are likely given
the history of diarrhea and distal limb edema. Hemorrhage secondary to the coagulopathy is
also possible, but is not described in the clinical history and does not appear likely with
polycythemia.


Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: These electrolyte changes are proportional and reflect
gastrointestinal losses that exceed water losses or volume repletion with hypotonic solutions.


Low anion gap: Hypoalbuminemia can cause a decreased anion gap because is it an
unmeasured anion.


Hyperbilirubinemia: In horses, anorexia should always be considered as a cause of hyperbilirubinemia. The concurrently elevated ALP, AST, and LDH indicate that liver disease is
another potential contributor to increased serum bilirubin. Hemolysis as a cause of hyperbilirubinemia is unlikely given the polycythemia.


Increased ALP, AST, LDH, and CK: The increased ALP, AST, and LDH are compatible with liver
disease, however these enzymes are not liver specific. The CK is also elevated, supporting
some contribution by muscle damage. GGT is more liver specific than the ALP in large
animals, however it is normal at this time. LDH has a short half-life, and suggests on going
tissue damage. Poor perfusion of many tissues secondary to dehydration and sepsis is likely.
The coagulation data is compatible with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and
suggests the potential for tissue necrosis secondary to thromboembolic disease. Intestinal
disease alone can cause secondary liver pathology as the portal circulation delivers potentially
high quantities of bacteria, bacterial toxins, and inflammatory mediators to the liver.


Coagulation profile: The combination of thrombocytopenia and prolonged PT and APTT
with increased fibrin degradation products meets the criteria for a mixed hemostatic defect,
likely DIC. Sepsis and vasculitis are likely causes for DIC in this patient, although severe liver
disease may also trigger DIC or DIC-like changes in coagulation data.


Abdominal fluid analysis: Transudate. This is within normal limits for abdominal fluid in the
horse.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Cha-Cha’s condition continued to deteriorate despite aggressive therapy, and she died after
developing profuse nasal bleeding. At necropsy, the cause of death was determined to be
extensive pulmonary thromboembolism. Severe necrotizing and ulcerative typhlocolitis and
acute neutrophilic periportal hepatitis and hepatocellular necrosis were also present.


This case may be compared to Salty (Case 9), who presented with a similarly severe gastrointestinal lesion in a more acute setting. At Salty’s presentation, fluid losses exceeded protein
loss so he was hyperalbuminemic. It is likely that had he survived longer, his laboratory data
could have eventually become similar to Cha Cha’s, in which tissue compromise and sepsis
resulted in marked loss of protein from the circulation. Chapter 5, Case 19 (Faith) is another
horse presenting with compromised bowel with protein loss into the gut who had a similar
negative outcome to Salty and Cha Cha. All of these horses had some evidence of
concurrent electrolyte loss assumed to be via the gut. This loss of protein and electrolytes
into the GI tract was also observed in Snickers, the puppy with parvoviral enteritis (Case 6).


Overview
Step 1: Remember that total proteins may be misleading and fractionation into albumin
and globulin may reveal abnormalities not apparent with only a total protein measurement
(Cases 1, 2, 7, 9)


Step 2: Evaluate the patient’s hydration status.


Dehydration may cause hyperalbuminemia (Case 9, 12) or may push a hypoalbuminemic
patient into the reference interval. Less often, dehydration may cause mild hyperglobulinemia
or push a hypoglobulinemic patient into the reference range.


Overhydration may have a dilutional effect.


Step 3: Does the patient have panhypoproteinemia? This suggests non-selective protein loss.


Is the patient bleeding? Case 3
Does the patient have exudative skin lesions?
Does the patient have cavity effusions? Case 3, 7
Does the patient have gastrointestinal disease? Case 4, 6, 9, 12, 14
Does the patient have edema/vasculitis? Case 5, 12


Step 4: If the patient has selective hypoalbuminemia, consider the following.


Evaluate body condition and diet for nutritional influences, which are rare (Case 1).


Consider increased demand for protein if the patient is febrile or has a history of surgery
or trauma. This usually causes only mild hypoalbuminemia in the absence of other factors.


Consider physiological downregulation of albumin production if there is evidence of
inflammation (albumin is a negative acute phase reactant) or concurrent hyperglobulinemia
(to regulate oncotic pressure). Case 7, 8


Evaluate liver function, especially if there is any combination of the following:
hypoglycemia, low BUN, hypocholesterolemia, hyperbilirubinemia, prolonged
coagulation times. Case 2


Perform a urinalysis. If there is proteinuria in a sample collected by cystocentesis with no
evidence of inflammation, glomerular loss of albumin may be occurring. This may be
further quantified by performing a urine protein:creatinine ratio. This is also recommended
as a more sensitive way to evaluate proteinuria if the urine is dilute (Case 5).


Step 5: If the patient is hyperglobulinemic, evaluate for inflammation/antigenic stimulation vs.
neoplasia.


The presence of inflammation can be supported by leukogram data, including the
presence of neutrophilia, left shift, toxic change, and lymphocytosis with reactive cells.
This is a more common cause of hyperglobulinemia and is usually associated with a
polyclonal gammopathy. Rarely a monoclonal gammopathy can occur with some
inflammatory diseases (Case 7).


The presence of neoplasia should be considered in older patients, patients with
hypercalcemia, mass lesions or organomegaly, lytic bone lesions, or patients with
peripheral cytopenias. Lymphadenopathy may occur with either neoplasia or
inflammation/antigenic stimulation. Monoclonal gammopathies usually reflect production
of a single immunoglobulin by neoplastic lymphocytes or plasma cells (Case 8).


Step 6: Consider the sum of the effects of all clinical factors on the protein values. Additive
effects may result in values within the reference range despite significant pathology.

##### Tests of Renal Function


The kidney is a central organ in the regulation of electrolyte, acid/base, and fluid balance, in
addition to having an important endocrine role in controlling calcium and phosphorus
homeostasis and erythropoiesis. This chapter will focus on BUN, creatinine, and urine specific
gravity as tests of renal function. Other abnormalities associated with renal disease will be
explained as has been the case in previous chapters, however for more detailed discussions
of electrolytes and minerals, the reader is referred to appropriate chapters in this text.
Urinalysis data will be discussed when available for the cases in this chapter, but a complete
review of urinalysis is beyond the scope of the book. The reader is referred to several
excellent resources for this information in the begining of this text.


Two sets of definitions should be reviewed prior to discussing tests of renal function. Both
will be important for describing and classifying patients with renal disease.


Azotemia: The presence of increased non-protein nitrogenous compounds in the blood.
This is routinely assessed by the measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine.


Uremia: The loss of a critical amount of renal function resulting in a group of clinical signs
that can include lethargy, anorexia, mucosal ulceration, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss,
anemia, altered urine output, and hyperparathyroidism.


In general, as renal disease progresses, urinary concentrating ability is lost first, followed by
the development of azotemia. Cats may retain some concentrating ability despite the
presence of renal azotemia. By the time clinical signs of uremia develop, the patient is almost
always azotemic and isosthenuric. In contrast, patients may be azotemic for some period of
time prior to the development of uremia. To further classify the potential causes for
azotemia, the condition is described as pre-renal, renal, or post-renal. These three
descriptors of azotemia are not mutually exclusive; as will be seen in the cases, any of the
three may occur in any combination in a patient.
