###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Smooch was treated with antibiotics and gastroprotectants along with insulin therapy for her
diabetes. Although becoming regenerative, her anemia worsened and she became hypoproteinemic secondary to gastrointestinal hemorrhage. As a result, she required a blood
transfusion. Her pneumonia gradually improved during her hospitalization. In addition, her
ketosis eventually resolved, and she was discharged on insulin with a nasogastric tube for
nutritional support. The dose of corticosteroids was reduced in order to minimize its effects
on the gastrointestinal tract and to improve sensitivity to insulin therapy.


The interpretation of Smooch’s laboratory work is more difficult because of her pre-existing
conditions and medications. Corticosteroid therapy may increase blood glucose levels and
induce liver enzymes as well as cause hypercholesterolemia. However, the glucose value here
would be too high for corticosteroid effects alone. Futhermore, some hepatobiliary disease
and/or hemolysis also could contribute given the anemia and hyperbilirubinemia. Pancreatitis
also may be associated with increased liver enzymes, hypercholesterolemia, hypocalcemia,
and hyperglycemia. In some cases, pancreatic disease can contribute to the development of
diabetes mellitus if insulin producing beta-cells are damaged as part of the process.


The pathogenesis of the electrolyte abnormalities is similarly murky because of the potential
for multiple contributing factors. As noted above, dilution of sodium is possible with diabetes
or cardiovascular disease, while increased losses through hemorrhage or third space effusions
cannot be ruled out. Unlike the previous two cases of diabetes (Jason and Decker, Chapter 7,
Cases 15 and 16), Smooch is hypokalemic. Some diabetics may have hyperkalemia (Chapter
3, Case 18; Chapter 5, Case 22) if insulin action is inadequate to promote the movement of
potassium into cells, while others have hypokalemia (Chapter 3, Case 19). Potassium may be
low because of decreased intake if Smooch is anorexic. Also, Smooch likely has increased


renal losses of potassium as tubular flow rates increase with glucose/ketone or glucocorticoid
induced diuresis. Because Smooch is already hypokalemic, her serum potassium values
should be monitored carefully when insulin therapy is instituted because insulin will cause
some translocation of serum potassium into cells. Rapid and dangerous fluctuations in
potassium may occur during treatment for diabetes even if the initial serum potassium values
are within reference intervals, so levels should be monitored carefully during initial
stabilization.

Case 18 – Level 3
“Zippy” is a 10-year-old castrated male schnauzer mix dog presenting for polyuria and
polydipsia. He has a history of arthritis that has been managed with glucosamine. Last month
he was diagnosed with Lyme disease and treated with doxycycline. After doxycycline therapy
was initiated, Zippy began urinating in the house. Blood work performed 2 weeks ago showed
marked hyperglycemia, however the owners did not want to treat this problem until they
returned from a two week vacation. When they returned from vacation yesterday, the petsitter indicated that Zippy had decreased appetite and had been lethargic over the last week.
This morning, Zippy was not ambulatory. On presentation, Zippy is recumbent and tachypneic
with pale mucous membranes. He is hypothermic and has melena on rectal examination.

###### **Intepretation**

CBC: Zippy has a mild lymphopenia that could be compatible with corticosteroid effects,
although other elements characteristic for the corticosteroid leukogram such as a mature
neutrophilia and monocytosis are not present. A viral infection causing lympholysis cannot be
ruled out, and the toxic changes in the neutrophils suggests some underlying inflammation.
But, based on the clinical history and other laboratory data, other processes such as a
gastrointestional lesion allowing loss of lymphocytes appear possible. Gastrointestinal loss of
lymphocytes is possible based on the panhypoproteinemia, as nonselective protein loss
occurs through the gut. With lymphangiectasia, cholesterol is also lost with lymph, usually
resulting in hypocholesterolemia. However, Zippy’s cholesterol currently is within reference
intervals. In addition, classical lymphangiectasia is not associated with melena.


Zippy has a microcytic, normochromic anemia. Microcytosis can be a normal characteristic of
some breeds (Akita, Shiba Inu), however it also is associated with portosystemic shunting and


iron deficiency. With the exception of albumin, serum biochemical parameters that may
decrease with impaired liver function such as glucose, BUN and cholesterol appear to be
increased or within the reference interval. Liver function tests such as serum bile acids would
be needed to rule out liver dysfunction. Iron deficiency may be a more likely explanation of
the anemia. Zippy has melena, which is a common cause of iron deficiency in older dogs.
Morphologic abnormalities of the erythrocytes that can accompany iron deficiency such as
hypochromasia and schistocytes are not reported, however they may occur later in the course
of disease than microcytosis. Thrombocytosis may also occur in iron deficient patients, but is
not noted here. Anemia of chronic disease may contribute to the anemia, however this is
typically normocytic and normochromic. Anemia due to hemorrhage is most often
regenerative, however occasionally the blood loss is too acute to show signs of regeneration
at the time of initial presentation.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Severe hyperglycemia: There are numerous potential causes for mild increases in blood
glucose. Hyperglycemia of this magnitude is almost certainly associated with diabetes
mellitus and is compatible with the clinical history of urinating in the house and
polydipsia/polyuria. A urinary tract infection may accompany diabetes mellitus and contribute
to changes in patterns of urination.


Increased BUN with normal creatinine: Elevated BUN may be related to the presence of
gastrointestinal hemorrhage, resulting in digestion of large amounts of protein. This may be
compounded by the potential for dehydration and low renal tubular flow rates if water intake
has not been sufficient to compensate for fluid losses due to osmotic diuresis. The presence
of large numbers of granular casts is very concerning because they contain the remains of
sloughed renal tubular epithelial cells, indicating the potential for serious kidney damage. In
this case, profound hyperglycemia may have been associated shock and hypoperfusion.


Hypocalcemia: Some of this change may be due to the hypoalbuminemia and decreases in
the protein bound fraction of calcium. Hypoalbuminemia-associated hypocalcemia should not
result in clinical signs because ionized calcium remains normal. However, this is a very low
total calcium value, and measurement of the biologically active ionized calcium is warranted.
Because of the increased amylase, pancreatitis should be considered as a potential cause for
hypocalcemia as well.


Panhypoproteinemia: Concurrent hypoalbuminemia and hypoglobulinemia most often
suggests nonselective protein losses. In this case, the melena suggests hemorrhage or
gastrointestinal protein loss. There is mild proteinuria, however this may be related to the
presence of urinary tract inflammation and is unlikely to significantly impact serum levels.
Other sources of nonselective protein loss are similar to routes of electrolyte loss and include
cutaneous and third space losses.


Hyponatremia: Increased losses of sodium may be occurring with gastrointestinal disease or
hemorrhage, and will be exacerbated if losses of electrolyte containing fluids are replaced
with water. The severe hyperglycemia draws fluid into the vascular space by osmosis, further
diluting out remaining sodium.


Hypochloremia: The corrected chloride is 108 mEq/L, indicating that changes in chloride are
of similar etiology to those described for sodium.


Hypokalemia: A number of factors are influencing Zippy’s potassium status. Low intake
because of anorexia compounds the potential for loss in the gastrointestinal tract. The


presence of glucosuria and ketonuria suggest that osmotic diuresis and increased tubular
flow rates are increasing urinary potassium losses. The negatively charged ketones also
promote potassium loss in the urine to preserve electrical neutrality. Impaired insulin activity
could increase extracellular fluid potassium content.


Increased anion gap and low bicarbonate: Zippy has a hypochloremic metabolic acidosis. In
his case, the increased anion gap may be attributable to the presence of ketoacids, although
poor perfusion associated with dehydration or circulatory compromise could cause a
superimposed lactic acidosis.


Increased ALP: Diabetes mellitus is one of the endocrinopathies that may be associated with
elevations in some liver enzymes. A concurrent corticosteroid induction cannot be ruled out.
Given the normal bilirubin and ALT, primary liver disease seems less likely at this time.


Increased AST: This elevation is a nonspecific indicator of tissue damage. If there is
hepatocellular damage, the ALT usually will also be increased, but is not the case here.
Perfusion deficits could contribute to tissue damage.


Hyperamylasemia: Decreased glomerular filtration rate is a common cause of increased
amylase in the dog, however elevations in amylase attributable to GFR are generally limited
to two to three fold elevations. Alternatively, there is evidence of intestinal disease, which
can also cause elevations in amylase. Finally, pancreatitis is possible.


Urinalysis: The urine is concentrated at this time. However, the presence of granular casts
(see Figure 7-6) can be a sign of renal tubular damage, and concentrating ability may decline
over time. Significant amounts of glucose and ketones in the urine will contribute to the urine
specific gravity measurement and may suggest greater concentrating ability than the dog is
truly capable of. Glucosuria can reflect tubular dysfunction or can occur when the tubular
maximum for reabsorption of glucose has been exceeded, which is clearly the case for this
patient. As discussed previously, the proteinuria could be compatible with glomerular
damage or with infectious/inflammatory urinary tract disease. Urinary tract infection is a
common complication of diabetes mellitus because of glucosuria and immune dysfunction
and is suggested by the presence of leukocytes and bacteria.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Despite therapy, Zippy’s clinical condition continued to deteriorate after presentation, and he
became anuric. The marked difficulty breathing suggested the potential for pulmonary
thromboembolism. His melena continued, and he began to vomit large amounts of blood.
He was euthanized due to poor response to therapy and grave prognosis.


The degree of Zippy’s hyperglycemia is unusual compared with the other cases of diabetes in
this book (Chapter 3, Cases 18, 19, 20; Chapter 5, Case 22, and the preceeding three cases in
this chapter), and is the most likely to cause significant shift of fluids from the interstitial to the
intravascular space, diluting electrolytes. Refer back to the Case Summary and Outcome for
the previous case (Smooch) for further discussion and comparison of variable electrolyte
abnormalities in the diabetes cases presented in several chapters of this book. Like Decker
(Chapter 7, Case 16), Zippy has an increased anion gap acidosis, likely due to the
accumulation of ketoacids associated with the diabetes mellitus. Based on the recumbency,
hypothermia, and casts in the urine, Zippy may have generalized tissue hypoperfusion and
lactic acidosis may complicate the ketoacidosis. Once he became anuric, uremic acidosis also
would have been present.


Case 19 – Level 3
“Stowaway” is a 3-year-old female alpaca presenting with a one week history of lateral
recumbency, bruxism, decreased appetite, and dullness. Several months ago, Stowaway gave
birth to a cria, was down for 2 days, and did not produce milk. At that time, she was
hospitalized for several days, diagnosed with gastrointestinal parasitism and treated. Three
months later she had another episode of recumbency and fecal flotation revealed parasitism.
Stowaway again responded well to treatment and gained weight. At this presention, the
alpaca is depressed and in sternal recumbancy. Stowaway is thin and has bilateral gut sounds
but no distinct compartmental contractions are noted. Fecal flotation is negative.
