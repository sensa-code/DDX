Hyperamylasemia: Increased amylase is frequently interpreted to signal pancreatic disease
such as pancreatitis. This certainly could be compatible with Fiero’s clinical history, although
the clinical chemistry abnormalities are not classic for pancreatitis. Alternatively, serum
amylase may also increase in association with intestinal disease, which may be the case in this
patient. Two to three-fold increases in amylase can be the result of decreased glomerular
filtration rate. Although Fiero is not azotemic, she appears dehydrated, which may result in
pre-renal decreases in glomerular filtration rate.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Abdominal radiographs showed foreign material in the pylorus and proximal duodenum.
Thoracic radiographs were unremarkable. Fiero was stabilized with fluids prior to surgery for
the removal of the foreign material, which turned out to be plastic food wrapping. Because
of her liver enzyme elevations, liver biopsy samples were collected at the time of gastrotomy.
Microscopic examination revealed chronic active peri-portal hepatitis that was interpreted to
be secondary to the recent history of gastrointestinal disease. Steroid hepatopathy was
superimposed on the inflammatory process and may have accounted for the relatively
pronounced elevation in ALP compared to the other liver enzymes. Although corticosteroids
had not been prescribed for Fiero, increased endogenous steroids could have contributed to
the hepatopathy. The owners also stated that she may have inadvertently been given
prednisone that had been prescribed for two other dogs in the household that have skin
disease. Fiero recovered uneventfully at home. The owners put the garbage can in the closet.


Case 6 – Level 2
“Francesca” is an 8-year-old spayed female Beagle presenting for evaluation of vomiting and
electrolyte abnormalities. Two weeks ago, she was initially evaluated by the referring
veterinarian following a few days of vomiting, lethargy, and diarrhea. At that time, she was
noted to be dehydrated and was treated with fluids, antibiotics, and a bland diet. She
presented to the referring veterinarian again 10 days later for progression of symptoms and
weakness. She has been vomiting after ingestion of any food, water, or medications, but is
polydipsic. She has not passed feces for several days. She was subsequently treated with with
corticosteroids, and when she did not respond, she was referred to the University. The owner
was not aware of any exposure to toxins or foreign material. He was somewhat concerned
that someone may have tried to poison Francesca because she occasionally barks at night.
Francesca has been generally healthy prior to this episode and is not taking any medications.
On presentation, Francesca is quiet but responsive and 10% dehydrated. She is tachycardic
and hypothermic with prolonged capillary refill times. Thoracic ausculatation was
unremarkable, but she was painful on abdominal palpation. A tubular object was palpable in
the mid-abdomen.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Francesca has a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis and a lymphopenia compatible with a
corticosteroid leukogram. She has been treated with corticosteroids and may have increased
levels of endogenously produced steroids due to her illness. Concurrent inflammation could
contribute to the mature neutrophilic leukocytosis. No toxic change or left shift are described
at this time, however these changes are not always present with inflammatory disease.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Both endogeneous and exogenous corticosteroids can cause hyperglycemia.
Diabetes mellitus could be compatible with the clinical signs, although abdominal pain is not
typical for diabetic patients unless there is concurrent gastroenteritis or pancreatitis.


Elevated BUN with normal creatinine: The urine specific gravity suggests adequate urinary
concentrating ability. BUN may increase prior to creatinine with decreased tubular flow rates
associated with dehydration. Sepsis may also cause an increase in BUN with no
corresponding change in creatinine. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage or a high protein diet can
elevate BUN but the latter is unlikely in patient unable to eat.


Hypermagnesemia: Given the dehydration, this abnormality likely reflects pre-renal
decreases in glomerular filtration rate.


Hyponatremia with disproportionately greater hypochloremia: Hyponatremia is rarely
dietary in origin even during periods of anorexia. Hyponatremia generally reflects a relative
gain of water compared to sodium and chloride or excessive loss of electrolytes. The pathophysiology of Francesca’s hyponatremia likely involves both mechanisms. She is experiencing
gastrointestinal losses of electrolytes associated with vomiting and diarrhea. In response to
the volume depletion, glomerular filtration rate declines. This results in increased isosmostic
reabsorption of sodium in the proximal tubule and decreased fluid flow in the distal tubules,
impairing water excretion. In addition, volume depletion will encourage release of
antidiuretic hormone, leading to further impairment in water excretion. Lastly, fluid losses are
often replaced with consumption of water because of increased thirst (note Francesca is
polydipsic), further diluting electrolyte levels in the circulation. Vomiting of the contents of
the proximal gastrointestinal tract associated with structural or functional obstruction is
associated with excessive loss of chloride (HCl), causing a hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis.


Hypokalemia: Francesca’s low serum potassium is caused by inadequate intake to
compensate for ongoing gastrointestinal losses. Hypokalemia in association with metabolic
alkalosis is compatible with vomiting of stomach contents or diuretic use, while hypokalemia
in association with metabolic acidosis is more frequently attributable to small intestinal
diarrhea, chronic renal failure, or distal renal tubular acidosis.


Increased HCO3 (alkalemia): Loss of hydrogen in addition to electrolytes because of the
vomiting of anterior gastrointestinal tract contents is causing the alkalosis.


Increased anion gap: Alkalosis and dehydration are potential causes for the increased anion
gap. In this case, a mixed acid/base disorder could develop secondary to lactic acidosis
associated with dehydration and poor tissue perfusion. Blood gas analysis may be indicated
to follow the acid/base status of this patient.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Francesca was taken to surgery and a corn cob was removed from her proximal small
intestine. The owners observed that it may have originated from a recently melted snow man
their children had made in the yard. Francesca was discharged and had an uneventful
recovery at home. Note that both Francesca and Fiero (this chapter, Case 5) had a history of
vomiting associated with foreign body ingestion with evidence of hypochloremia and
metabolic alkalosis, however Francesca had more pronounced electrolyte abnormalities. This
is probably the result of Francesca’s more protracted clinical course prior to surgical
correction of the small intestinal blockage, although in theory, Fiero’s angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitor treatment could have helped maintain her serum potassium levels. Despite
Francesca’s more serious clinical signs, there are no liver enzyme elevations that suggest
steroid hepatopathy, though she does have a corticosteroid leukogram.


Case 7 – Level 2
“Snow” is an 11-year-old spayed female Bichon Frise presenting for a few days of lethargy,
decreased appetite, and 2 episodes of vomiting. For the past 8 months, she has had a
chronic cough. This was attributed to heart disease based on radiographs and
echocardiogram. She was subsequently treated with furosemide and cough suppressants. On
physical examination, Snow is icteric, dehydrated, and has a 3/6 heart murmur.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: not available


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: The use of diuretics will contribute to increased renal
losses of electrolytes (See Chapter 7, Case 11). The corrected chloride is still slightly low (104
mEq/L), which may be observed in patients taking furosemide. Replacement of fluids and
electrolytes lost through the gastrointestinal tract with oral water intake can dilute remaining
serum electrolytes. Congestive heart failure will evoke mechanisms of renal fluid retention
and increased thirst to increase intravascular water in an attempt to restore circulation to
tissues that are not adequately perfused because of poor cardiac function. This will further
dilute remaining serum electrolytes.


Hypokalemia: Similar to sodium and chloride, some types of diuretics cause renal potassium
wasting. This drain on potassium may be compounded by gastrointestinal losses and low intake.


Hyperbilirubinemia: Major diagnostic considerations for hyperbilirubinemia include
hemolysis and cholestatic liver disease. Sepsis and decreased liver function often cause
milder hyperbilirubinemia. Evaluating the potential for hemolytic disease requires at least a
packed cell volume and preferably a complete CBC. The marked elevation in ALP is
compatible with cholestasis, supported by the hypercholesterolemia. Significant increases in
the ALT and AST support concurrent hepatocellular damage while severely impaired liver


function seems less likely because the BUN, glucose, and albumin are normal and the
cholesterol is increased. Serum bile acids would be a more sensitive way to evaluate liver
function deficits.


Increased ALP: As described above, markedly increased ALP is suggestive for cholestatic
disease, which would be supported by an increased GGT if available. There are numerous
potential causes for elevated ALP including some medications and endocrinopathies such as
diabetes or hyperadrenocortocism, which are not consistent with the history, physical
examination findings, and other clinical chemistry data.


Increased ALT and AST: Elevations in these enzymes indicate hepatocellular damage,
although muscle damage also could contribute to the increases. A creatine kinase
measurement could help determine if concurrent muscle damage is occurring.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Abdominal ultrasound revealed a small liver, a moderate sized gall bladder with no evidence
of blockage, and a hypoechoic, slightly enlarged pancreas. Biopsy of the liver showed chronic
active hepatitis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, piece-meal necrosis, and moderate
portal fibrosis. Food was withheld from Snow due to the vomiting, and she was treated with
antibiotics, fluids and gastrointestinal protectants. When she was eventually fed, she
exhibited decreased mentation compatible with hepatic encephalopathy. At that time, a low
protein diet was implemented and ursodeoxycholic acid and lactulose were added to her
treatment plan. A cardiology consult was requested by the owner, and Snow was found to
have 4+ mitral regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation without evidence of heart failure
and excellent contractility. Cardiology recommended changing the treatment of her cardiac
disease to an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor with furosemide as needed to control
clinical signs once her liver disease was better controlled. Eight weeks after discharge, Snow
was re-evaluated and was doing very well with no clinical signs of liver disease and a normal
serum bilirubin. The owners had noted an increase in her coughing, however radiographic
evaluation showed clear lung fields and reduced heart size compared to her last evaluation.


Snow’s case demonstrates the interaction between the effects of medication and multiple
disease processes. Like Fiero (Chapter 7, Case 5), the diuretic therapy may have potentiated
the development of electrolyte abnormalities associated with vomiting and anorexia. Patients
taking medications that could influence electrolyte homeostasis should have their serum
electrolyte levels monitored periodically. In some cases, doses of medications must be
adjusted or alternative therapies instituted in response to laboratory abnormalities.


Case 8 – Level 2
“Delaney” is a 13-year-old Morgan mare presenting with signs of colic. On presentation,
Delaney was quiet and her vital parameters were within normal limits. Abdominal palpation
revealed a markedly distended cecum. She was taken to surgery on Day 1 to relieve a cecal
impaction. An incomplete cecal bypass was performed in which the jejunum was
anastomosed to the right ventral colon. Delaney recovered from anesthesia uneventfully.
However 4 days post-surgery, she was in pain and had a fever, so additional laboratory work
was performed.
