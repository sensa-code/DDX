Hypoproteinemia: On Day 1 there is mild hypoalbuminemia. Glomerular disease can result in
selective loss of albumin in the urine but it seems unlikely that acute intoxication leading to
renal damage would cause low serum albumin in a matter of hours. Hemorrhage is a possible
cause of the hypoalbuminemia, but the bleeding at this time is not of sufficient duration or
severity to lower the PCV or globulins below the lower limit of the reference interval.
Comparison with any available historical data to determine if Joe normally has a low normal
albumin would be helpful in understanding the clinical significance of this value. By days 3
and 4 there is anemia and panhypoproteinemia characteristic of hemorrhage.


Hyperchloremic acidosis with decreased anion gap: Small bowel diarrhea causes
hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis because of the loss of fluid with high bicarbonate content
and low chloride concentration. The anion gap often will be normal in these cases. This
interpretation is supported by the hypokalemia. Accumulation of uremic acids should
increase the anion gap, however this is offset by the developing hypoproteinemia. Negatively


charged plasma proteins represent a significant proportion of the unmeasured anions under
normal circumstances.


Hypocholesterolemia: Low serum cholesterol is not generally associated with clinical signs,
however it may occur in association with protein-losing enteropathy, decreased liver function,
or severe malnutrition. The combination of hypoalbuminemia and hypocholesterolemia early
in the course of disease could be compatible with a pre-existing liver function problem such
as a portocaval shunt, especially in a high risk breed such as the Yorkshire terrier. Serum bile
acid measurement should eventually be considered in this patient. Decreased liver function
would certainly interfere with Joe’s ability to increase albumin synthesis in compensation for
increased renal or gastrointestinal losses.


Urinalysis: As noted above, Joe is isosthenuric. The glucosuria could indicate renal tubular
dysfunction, or the possibility that the hyperglycemia previously exceeded the tubular
maximum for reabsorption of 180-200 mg/dl. The proteinuria may be partially related to the
presence of blood in the urine, lower urinary tract disease, or glomerular lesions. Dipstick
protein measurements are generally more sensitive to albumin than globulins, and this level
of proteinuria is considered significant in dilute urine. A urine protein:creatinine ratio could
be performed to quantify the proteinuria, but is only recommended if lower urinary tract
sources of protein are ruled out.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Joe was admitted to the hospital and activated charcoal was administered to prevent further
absorption of any remaining ibuprofen. He also was treated with intravenous fluids, gastroprotectants, antiemetics, total parenteral nutrition, and antibiotics because of the concern
that bacterial translocation may occur with compromised intestines. Despite this therapy, Joe
vomited blood several times and began to have episodes of diarrhea containing digested
blood. A blood transfusion and albumin were given to compensate for his gastrointestinal
blood loss. After six days of therapy, he showed signs of fluid overload and was treated with
oxygen and diuretics. Despite the propensity for patients with renal disease to develop
hypertension, Joe’s blood pressure was normal throughout his hospitalization. His azotemia
improved over time, and he was discharged from the hospital. While his long term prognosis
is unclear, some renal function may be regained over time. Early and aggressive treatment
with normalization of BUN and creatinine are encouraging. This case can be compared with
ibuprofen toxicity in a ferret (Calvin, Case 20, Chapter 2), where both hepatic and renal
abnormalities were present.


Joe’s renal disease was acute due to a nephrotoxic drug and was diagnosed early. Many
cases of renal failure are diagnosed late in the course of disease (see Chapter 5, Cases 9 and
10), and the initiating causes are never discovered. Differentiation of acute from chronic renal
failure can be difficult, and the occurrence of acute exacerbations of more chronic processes
can complicate the distinction. Acute presentation, especially with a history of potential
ischemia or toxin exposure, implies acute renal failure, however development of clinical signs
may be subtle in chronic renal failure, and acute decompensation of chronic renal disease
may give the clinical impression of recent onset. Patients with chronic renal failure are more
likely to present with poor body condition, or small firm kidneys, versus patients with acute
renal failure who may present in good flesh with normal to enlarged kidneys.


Laboratory data are not always helpful in determining whether renal failure is acute or
chronic. Patients with acute renal failure may be more likely to present with oliguria/anuria
and therefore hyperkalemia (Vaden). However, terminal chronic renal failure can be present
with decreased urine production and potassium retention as seen in Margarite (Case 9).


Acute post-renal azotemia can also be associated with hyperkalemia, such as in cats with
urinary obstruction (Ringo, Chapter 5, Case 7). Joe’s serum potassium was low despite acute
renal failure, possibly because of gastrointestinal losses and the maintenance of adequate
urine production throughout his hospitalization. The metabolic acidosis may be more severe
with acute renal failure because there has been less time for physiologic adaptation to
decreased renal function.


The presence of non-regenerative anemia is more common in chronic renal failure, however
the above cases illustrate the limitation of this data for prediction of acute versus chronic
renal disease. The horse with chronic renal failure (Margarite, Case 9) was not anemic. Ringo,
the cat with chronic renal failure was moderately anemic. Joe developed anemia along with
his renal failure, because of gastrointestinal hemorrhage associated with non-steroidal antiinflammatory toxicity. Blood loss anemias are usually regenerative, however Joe’s
erythropoietic response may have been limited by the presence of renal disease. Indices
were not available to judge Joe’s response to the blood loss. Often the clinician must rely on
the combination of history, clinical signs, and laboratory data to determine the likelihood of
acute or chronic renal failure.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Pugsley has a mild neutrophilic leukocytosis which could be compatible with mild
inflammation.


There is a mild microcytic, normochromic anemia. Causes of microcytosis in dogs are limited
and include breed characteristic (Japanese breeds such as Akitas, Chows or Shar Peis), iron
deficiency, and portosystemic vascular anomolies. An iron panel could be performed to
clarify Pugsley’s iron status, however Pugsley has other data compatible with a portosystemic
shunt (hypoglycemia, low BUN, hypoalbuminemia, mild elevations of liver enzymes). If
Pugsley is eating a standard commercial dog food, he is unlikely to have a dietary deficiency
of iron. No obvious chronic blood loss has been noted by the owner. Pugsley should be
checked for evidence of parasites; it would be more cost effective to perform a fecal
flotation and to check for fleas and ticks than to run an iron panel at this time. In addition,
iron deficiency may be accompanied by hypochromia and schistocytes, which are not seen
here, while liver disease can be characterized by the presence of target cells, which were
present on this blood film.


The mild thrombocytopenia is of questionable clinical significance at this time. Although no
platelet clumping was reported, a repeat CBC should be considered to rule out artifactual
thrombocytopenia prior to pursuing any other diagnostics for thrombocytopenia. This degree
of thrombocytopenia will not be associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage provided
that platelet function and other hemostatic parameters are normal. Because there is evidence
of decreased liver function on the serum biochemical profile, a coagulation profile should be
run prior to invasive procedures.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: In patients with no clinical signs of hypoglycemia, artifactual hypoglycemia
due to inappropriate sample processing should be ruled out by measuring glucose on a
freshly collected sample with prompt separation of serum from cells. In this case, the
hypoglycemia was verified. After processing error, the most likely cause for low blood


glucose in this case is decreased liver function, possibly related to a portosystemic shunt.
Because of the neutrophilic leukocytosis, sepsis may be considered as a cause for
hypoglycemia, however it is unlikely in a dog with no apparent clinical signs. Neoplasia is also
unlikely in a young dog, and there is no history of starvation or poor body condition.


Decreased BUN and creatinine: Low BUN may be attributed to poor liver function
secondary to the presence of a portosystemic shunt. Given the low urine specific gravity, high
tubular flow rates in the kidney with decreased time for reabsorption of urea may contribute
to low BUN in this case. Polyuria and polydipsia were not described in the clinical history, but
are frequently associated with poor liver function in dogs because of a combination of
potential mechanisms including psychogenic polydipsia, alterations in osmoreceptors,
stimulation of thirst centers, and/or increased endogenous cortisol levels associated with
increased production or decreased degradation of corticosteroids. Low muscle mass in a
young, small breed dog could also conceivably contribute to low creatinine. Some patients
with portosystemic shunts grow poorly and are small compared to litter mates.


Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia: Hypoalbuminemia can be due to decreased
production or increased losses. Because the liver is the site of albumin production, poor liver
function can cause hypoalbuminemia. In some cases, albumin production may be low
because of lack of substrate (starvation/malnutrition, unlikely in this case because of lack of
supporting clinical data), or because the liver downregulates albumin production as part of
the acute phase response (the neutrophilic leukocytosis suggests some degree of
inflammation). Most causes of increased protein losses result in the loss of both albumin and
globulins (hemorrhage, gastrointestinal losses, dermal or third space protein losses). Because
of the microcytic anemia, there is some question of chronic blood loss, however hemorrhage
should be associated with loss of both albumin and globulin proteins. Exclusive loss of
albumin causing hypoalbuminemia occurs via the glomerulus, however proteinuria was not
noted on the urinalysis. Because the urine was relatively dilute, a urine protein:creatinine ratio
could be performed as a more sensitive indicator of proteinuria. Based on all of Pugsley’s
laboratory results, evaluation of liver function by performing fasted and post-prandial bile
acids measurements is a better choice to determine the cause of hypoalbuminemia.


Low anion gap: The anion gap is an indicator of unmeasured anions, most of which are
negatively charged plasma proteins. As a result, hypoproteinemia causes a decrease in anion
gap.


Mild increase in ALP: Increases in ALP are nonspecific in dogs and may be related to a
variety of extrahepatic causes, drug or hormone effects, or cholestasis. Significant cholestatic
disease is often accompanied by an increase in GGT or bilirubin, which are not seen here.
Mild liver enzyme elevations are often described in association with portosystemic shunts and
is the most likely cause in this case. Increased ALP is seen with bone formation in young,
growing, large breed dogs, but is unlikely in a small dog like Pugsley.


Mild increase in ALT and AST: These changes are mild and indicate hepatocellular damage.
As with ALP, many hepatic and extrahepatic causes of liver enzyme elevation are possible,
but the preponderance of evidence supports the presence of a portosystemic shunt.


Decreased amylase: This value is not considered clinically significant.


Urinalysis: Pugsley has a low urine specific gravity, but is not azotemic. Interpretation of
isosthenuria as physiologic or pathologic depends on clinical information such as hydration
status. Because impaired ability to concentrate urine appears prior to azotemia, decreased renal


function cannot be ruled out. Liver failure may also interfere with renal concentrating ability in
the absence of renal pathology. Polyuria may be seen in animals with portosystemic shunts.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Both fasted and post-prandial serum bile acid concentrations were elevated.
Ultrasonagraphic evaluation of Pugsley’s abdomen showed a small liver and a large
extrahepatic portosystemic shunt. The shunt was corrected by cellophane banding. He was
discharged and recovered well at home. Pugleys’ case demonstrates how a primary liver
disease can influence renal variables, including BUN, creatinine, and urine specific gravity.
Please see Chapter 2, Case 12 (Binar) and Chapter 3, Case 7 (Yap Yap) for more complete
discussions of the pathophysiology of portosytemic shunts.


Case 13 – Level 3
“Opie” is a 5-year-old castrated male domestic short haired cat presenting with a several day
history of vomiting and inability to hold down any food. He was taken to another veterinarian
last week because the owner thought he was drinking and urinating more than usual, however
no blood work was performed at that time. On physical examination, Opie is noted to sneeze
occasionally, does not appear to be dehydrated, and has a mass in the area of the left kidney
which could be fat. An intermittent II/VI systolic heart murmur is noted on auscultation.
