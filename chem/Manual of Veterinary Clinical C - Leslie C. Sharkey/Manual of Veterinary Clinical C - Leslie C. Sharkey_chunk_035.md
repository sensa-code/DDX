Figure 5-1. Cytology of
transitional cell carcinoma from the
urinary bladder mass.


Sherpa’s case demonstrates how severe urinary tract disease may be present with minimal
indication on the serum biochemical profile. What azotemia is present is attributable to the
post-renal obstructive effects of the transitional cell carcinoma. Increased pressure in the
tubules secondary to outflow obstruction can result in either transient or permanent
decreases in tubular function depending on the duration and severity of the pressure. Renal
function may increase over time as temporary losses of renal tubular function are regained
and as remaining functional nephrons undergo compensatory hypertrophy with enhanced
function. Alternatively, there may be ongoing losses of renal function because at a certain
point, renal lesions can progress despite correction of the initial cause of injury. Because of
these factors, sequential serum biochemical profiles on the patient may show normalization
of abnormalities or progressive azotemia with the development of other biochemical
abnormalities that accompany renal failure. Chemotherapy may result in temporary relief of
obstruction, however the long-term prognosis is poor.


This case should be compared with Case 1, Marklar, in which pre-renal factors caused a more
significant increase in BUN and creatinine despite absence of renal disease. Therefore, the
degree of azotemia does not always distinguish pre-renal from renal changes or their
potential reversibility. Marklar’s ability to concentrate his urine was a key indicator of
adequate renal function despite the azotemia.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Marsali is anemic. With the limited clinical history, anemia of chronic disease or
malnutrition are likely causes, however poor management also suggests the possibility of
parasitism. Blood loss is possible with the concurrent hypoalbuminemia, however nutritional
factors could influence this analyte as well.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: This change is minimal and is unlikely to be clinically significant. Anorexia is
an uncommon cause of hypoglycemia but is more likely in cases of advanced starvation like
Marsali. Even under these extreme circumstances, blood glucose is often maintained within
or just slightly below reference range.


Low BUN and creatinine: Low protein diets and poor muscle mass can result in decreased
BUN and creatinine. Increased glomerular filtration rate and water retention associated with
pregnancy can decrease creatinine, while polyuria can decrease BUN. Marsali was not
pregnant and her urine output appeared to be normal.


Hyperproteinemia characterized by hypoalbuminemia and hyperglobulinemia: Both
decreased hepatic production and increased losses can lower serum albumin. Marsali is one
of the rare cases in which decreased production may be due to starvation. Because albumin
is a negative acute phase reactant, hepatic production may be suppressed with inflammation.
This mechanism seems plausible given the hyperglobulinemia, however supporting evidence
such as hyperfibrinogenemia and an inflammatory leukogram are not available in this case.


Because albumin is a readily usable protein reserve, hypoalbuminemia can occur with fever,
surgery, or other causes of increased catabolism. Selective loss of albumin is characteristic of
glomerular lesions, while most other causes of protein loss (gastrointestinal, dermal, or third
space loss) include both albumin and globulins. Hyperglobulinemia is due to increased acute
phase reactants and/or immunoglobulins. Polyclonal expansions are associated with antigenic
stimulation, and infectious disease is likely given the management at Marsali’s farm.
Hyperglobulinemia due to monoclonal gammopathy is often associated with hematopoietic
malignancies such as lymphoma or multiple myeloma, although in small animals, infectious
diseases such as feline infectious peritonitis, tick borne pathogens and _Leishmania_ rarely can
cause monoclonal gammopathy.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Marsali was wormed and placed on an appropriate diet. She responded very well, gained 51
pounds while in the hospital, and was transferred to the Minnesota Hooved Animal Rescue
Foundation, a local group that rehabilitates abused or neglected livestock, where she
completed her recovery (Figure 5-2B).

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Jag has a mild neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, while the packed cell volume is still
within the normal range. The combination of bicytopenia with the presence of atypical
lymphocytes is reason to consider bone marrow evaluation. The concurrent hypercalcemia can
be an indication for bone marrow biopsy by itself, and in combination with bicytopenia it is a
strong rationale for the procedure if no extramarrow cause for the bicytopenia is apparent.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia: Classically, the combination of azotemia and isosthenuria is interpreted to be
evidence of renal failure. In general, this is true, however in some cases, extra-renal factors
may interfere with urinary concentrating ability in the absence of significant structural renal
lesions. Examples include diabetes insipidus, medullary washout, or bacterial toxins in
pyometra. In this case, the patient is hyposthenuric, which implies some ability of the kidney
to modify the filtrate, and therefore some renal function. Hypercalcemia can result in
temporary reversible renal dysfunction in the short term, or actual renal damage and
subsequent renal failure in the long term. If the azotemia is merely due to the obligatory fluid
losses associated with temporary polyuria, the azotemia may be pre-renal. It may not be
possible to determine which is more likely from the data available at this time. Imaging
studies of the kidney and repeat biochemistry and urinalysis after correction of hypercalcemia
are required to categorize the azotemia in these cases. See below for description of the
mechanisms for azotemia associated with hypercalcemia.


Hypercalcemia with normal phosphorus: After ruling out laboratory artifact, hypercalcemia
of malignancy should be a primary differential diagnosis in this case. Lymphoma is a common
cause of hypercalcemia of malignancy, however multiple myeloma, thymoma, anal sac
apocrine gland adenocarcinoma, and other carcinomas also may be associated with
hypercalcemia. The serum phosphorus is generally normal or decreased in patients with
hypercalcemia of malignancy, although concurrent decrements in glomerular filtration rate
with the development of renal complications could elevate phosphorus concentrations.
Hypercalcemia of malignancy may be confirmed by identifying a causative neoplasm and/or
demonstrating increased concentrations of parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP) and
low to normal parathyroid hormone (PTH). Another consideration for hypercalcemia with
normal to low serum phosphorus is primary hyperparathyroidism. In that case, the presence
of a parathyroid tumor with an elevated PTH but normal PTHrP would be expected. Renal
failure and hypervitaminosis D may also elevate serum calcium, but are typically associated
with hyperphosphatemia. Other causes of hypercalcemia such as skeletal lesions and bone
growth, granulomatous disease, hemoconcentration, or hypoadrenocorticism are less likely
based on the clinical history and the degree of hypercalcemia noted in this patient.


Hypokalemia: A combination of decreased intake with anorexia and increased losses due to
polyuria contribute to hypokalemia in this case. Gastrointestinal losses are also possible with
the history of vomiting. There is no evidence of acid/base abnormalities that would cause
intracellular translocation of potassium.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Ultrasound evaluation of the parathyroid gland and abdomen failed to reveal any lesions,
however a bone marrow aspirate contained large numbers of immature lymphocytes
compatible with a lymphoid neoplasm (Figure 5-3). This was considered sufficient to explain
the hypercalcemia, and PTHrP levels were not measured. The pathogenesis of hypercalcemia
of malignancy will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 6, but briefly, PTHrP stimulates
osteoclastic bone resorption and renal calcium reabsorption. Dehydration may further


compromise renal calcium excretion. Jag underwent chemotherapy for his cancer and the
hypercalcemia resolved with therapy. After his calcium levels normalized, Jag began
concentrating his urine again with no observable deficit in renal function. Jag should be
compared with Marklar in Case 1, who had pre-renal azotemia with concentrated urine, which
made it easier to verify adequate renal function. Marklar also had hyperphosphatemia, which
generally accompanies decreased GFR, except in cases like Jag, where other factors may be
lowering serum phosphorus.

lymphoma. The very large central
cell is a megakaryocyte.


Jag is a good example of a patient with azotemia and a low urine specific gravity that does
not have irreversible chronic renal failure, although it was not possible to be sure of this
based on only the initial blood work. Hypercalcemia can cause a nephrogenic diabetes
insipidus-like syndrome because of decreased tubular reabsorption of sodium and
interference with the action of antidiuretic hormone on renal tubules. These responses are
mediated by calcium-sensing receptors on renal epithelial cells and are designed to promote
excretion of excess calcium. Renal medullary blood flow may increase in hypercalcemic dogs,
with resultant medullary washout and impaired concentrating ability. Production of large
amounts of dilute urine results in dehydration and pre-renal azotemia.


With chronic and severe hypercalcemia, calcium-mediated vasoconstriction and subsequent
ischemia combined with direct toxic effects of calcium on renal tubular cells can cause
permanent nephron loss and renal failure. At this point, the patient is typically isosthenuric,
and other clinical and laboratory signs of renal failure may become apparent.

decreased appetite and weight loss over the past several months. More recently, Sheba has
been experiencing shifting leg lameness. On presentation, Sheba has peripheral
lymphadenopathy, and cytologic specimens were collected.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Sheba has mild toxic change, which could be compatible with inflammation or marrow
insult. Future CBC’s should be monitored for additional evidence of inflammation. Sheba also
has a normocytic, normochromic anemia and thrombocytopenia. A reticulocyte count should
be done to determine if the anemia is nonregenerative. Anemia of chronic disease should
always be considered as a potential cause of mild nonregenerative anemia. The isosthenuria
and azotemia are evidence of renal damage, which may result in a nonregenerative anemia
because of inadequate production of erythropoietin and the toxic effects of uremia on the
bone marrow microenvironment. Sheba should also be evaluated for acute blood loss, which
could initially cause a nonregenerative anemia and thrombocytopenia. The low normal
protein and hypoalbuminemia may be compatible with blood loss. Blood loss is not always
obvious to owners, especially if the losses are gastrointestinal and up to a week may be
required to see evidence of regeneration on a CBC. If no peripheral causes for the
bicytopenia can be found, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are indicated.
