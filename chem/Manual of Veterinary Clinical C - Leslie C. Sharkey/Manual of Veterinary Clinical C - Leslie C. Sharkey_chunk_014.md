###### **Interpretation**

CBC: The leukogram is characterized by a mild mature neutrophilic leukocytosis, lymphopenia,
and monocytosis compatible with a corticosteroid leukogram. This may be related to stress, or
from the skin and dental disease. If corticosteroids have been administered to this dog orally
or topically, medication could contribute to the changes in leukocytes. The neutrophilic
leukocytosis may also reflect the inflammation of the ears or oral cavity.


Serum Biochemistry
Hypoglycemia: Because this patient does not have any clinical signs referable to
hypoglycemia, laboratory artifact should be ruled out prior to invasive or expensive work-up
for other conditions that cause hypoglycemia. Resubmission of a freshly collected sample
with special attention to prompt separation of serum from cells is recommended.


Hyperkalemia: The significance of this mild deviation from the reference interval is unclear.
Potassium may also leak from cells if there is a significant delay in separating the cells from
the serum. In the absence of clinical signs, an individual analyte value that falls slightly
outside the reference interval could be “normal” for this particular patient as a result of
biological variation (see introductory chapter on the development of reference intervals).
Repeat analysis may reveal that the analyte falls back into the reference interval. If repeat
analysis shows a greater deviation from the reference interval or other accompanying
abnormalities, further diagnostic work may be indicated.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome:**

Inquiry into the processing of this sample led to the discovery that there had been a
significant delay between the collection of this sample and centrifugation, leading to
consumption of glucose in the sample by cells. This patient did not have clinical or laboratory
evidence of sepsis, liver failure, neoplasia, or nutritional deficits. Repeat sampling revealed
normal serum glucose concentrations.


GI Case 4 – Level 1
“Kippy” is a 12-year-old neutered male poodle presenting for lethargy of two weeks duration
and progressive abdominal distention. His appetite has been decreased for two days and he
has vomited once. On physical examination, Kippy’s abdomen is very distended and a fluid
wave is palpable. His hair coat is sparse and he has numerous subcutaneous masses. He has a
low-grade fever. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a very large abdominal mass that
encompasses a large portion of the abdominal cavity and is compressing the stomach and
bladder. The mass appears to arise from the liver, is attached by a pedicle, and contains
numerous cystic structures.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Kippy has a neutrophilic leukocytosis with a left shift and toxic change, indicating
significant inflammation. His anemia is macrocytic hypochromic, therefore likely regenerative,
although a reticulocyte count is required to quantitate the response. The increased numbers
of nucleated erythrocytes may have entered the circulation as part of a regenerative
response or as a result of endothelial insult (i.e. hypoglycemia, hypoxia, endotoxemia) or
abnormality of hematopoietic tissues. Moderate thrombocytopenia is likely due to increased
consumption of platelets; decreased production is less likely based on the good activity in
the other hematopoietic cell types. The cause of increased consumption cannot be
determined on the basis of this data alone; however platelets may be adhering to damaged
endothelium or may be consumed as a result of early DIC. A coagulation profile would help
clarify the status of hemostasis in this patient.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: Artifactual hypoglycemia was ruled out in this case by repeated measurement
in properly processed samples. Because of the large pedunculated liver mass, paraneoplastic
hypoglycemia should be considered. Sepsis is a possible cause of hypoglycemia in this case
based on the marked inflammatory leukogram and the thrombocytopenia. Cultures of blood,
urine, and any suspicious lesions could help evaluate this possibility. Starvation induced
hypoglycemia is relatively uncommon and is usually associated with very long periods of food
deprivation and poor body condition, which were not noted here.


Increased AST: As an isolated finding, the increased AST is of limited diagnostic value.
Hypoxia of tissues secondary to anemia could contribute to the elevation. The relation of this
value to the liver mass is unclear given the normal ALT.


Increased amylase: Increases in amylase are most often associated with pancreatic or
intestinal pathology or with decreased glomerular filtration rate. In this case, pancreatic and
intestinal disease cannot be ruled out. The absence of azotemia makes decreased GFR an
unlikely cause for the hyperamylasemia. A less common but potential cause for increased
serum amylase is hepatic neoplasia, which is compatible with the clinical signs and history in
this patient. (See Cases 13 and 14 in this chapter).

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Kippy was treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, and a twelve-pound mass was
surgically removed from Kippy’s abdomen (Figure 3-2). Histologic examination revealed a
low-grade hepatocellular carcinoma with areas of coagulation necrosis and hemorrhage. The
subcutaneous masses were lipomas. Kippy recovered from surgery and was discharged.
Blood work repeated five days after surgery showed resolution of the hypoglycemia and
improvement of the hematologic abnormalities, eliminating concern for other potential
causes of the hypoglycemia. Note that the clinical chemistry data for Gretchen (Case 4) and
Kippy are almost identical, and yet Gretchen’s hypoglycemia was artifactual and of no
diagnostic significance, while Kippy’s hypoglycemia was the result of serious underlying
disease. The comparison of the two cases highlights the need to interpret clinical chemistry
data in the context of the history and other laboratory data, both of which were suspicious
for significant disease in Kippy’s case.


Tumor associated hypoglycemia has been reported in people and dogs, and possibly in
horses (Bagley, Baker, Beaudry). Mesenchymal, epithelial, and hematopoietic tumors may
cause hypoglycemia. Mesenchymal and epithelial tumors are often large and occur in the
chest or abdomen. Although these tumors could consume substantial amounts of glucose,
another mechanism has been shown to be the critical factor causing hypoglycemia. In many
cases, these tumors secrete incompletely processed insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), a
hormone that causes hypoglycemia by activating the insulin receptor (Le Roth). Normally,


IGF-II is produced in the liver. After secretion into the circulation, IGF-II forms a complex with
a binding protein which limits the biological activity. In contrast, the abnormally processed
IGF-II produced by tumors does not complex with the binding protein, and therefore it is free
to interact with the insulin receptor to inhibit glucose production by the liver, thus increasing
peripheral uptake of glucose by other tissues.


A retrospective study of dogs with massive hepatocellular carcinoma showed that the
majority of patients had elevations in three or more serum liver enzyme activities, and that
elevations in serum ALT and AST were negative prognostic indicators (Liptak). Despite this,
overall mortality was low and no local recurrence was noted after surgical removal of the
tumor, even when the tumor was incompletely excised. Tumor associated hypoglycemia was
only noted in two of 48 dogs.

GI Case 5 – Level 1
“Ides” is a 4-year-old castrated male ferret. The owner has the impression that Ides has been
slightly weak and quiet for several weeks. He says that Ides collapsed and had a seizure over
the weekend. Ides presents to you on emergency with another episode of collapse. His face
is smeared with saliva, and he is recumbent and minimally responsive.

###### **Interpretation**

Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: This sample was processed correctly, and in combination with the clinical signs,
true hyperglycemia is considered to be present in this patient. Although there are numerous
potential causes for hypoglycemia, ferrets with blood glucose concentrations lower than 60
mg/dl are likely to have insulinomas due to the prevalence of this tumor in this species.


Mildly increased in ALT and AST: With the exception of liver tumors, primary hepatic
disease is rare in ferrets. In ferrets, repeated bouts of hypoglycemia will mobilize fat stores to
the liver, causing hepatocellular swelling and increased liver enzymes. The possibility of
metastasis of an insulinoma must also be considered.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

This patient was initially managed conservatively with medical therapy, which included
frequent feedings and prednisone. Although this regime will frequently control clinical signs
for a period of time, Ides continued to have periods of lethargy and weakness, but no further
episodes of collapse. Ides was eventually taken to surgery, and three firm pancreatic nodules
were palpated and removed, and a liver biopsy was performed. Histologic examination of
tissues revealed multiple benign insulinomas and glycogen infiltration of hepatocytes with no
evidence of metastatic disease. Ides was discharged and recovered uneventfully. Like Kippy,
the remainder of the clinical chemistry profile was relatively unremarkable despite the
presence of neoplasia. This may be the case with many types of tumors. When measured,
patients with insulinoma have normal to high insulin levels associated with hypoglycemia,


while patients with other malignancies that cause hypoglycemia often have appropriately low
circulating insulin.


Insulinomas are one of the most common tumors in middle-aged ferrets, and they may be
present concurrently with other common tumors of ferrets such as adrenal tumors. Clinical
signs result from pronounced hypoglycemia secondary to continuous hyperinsulinemia. The
normal counter-regulatory mechanisms that increase blood glucose concentrations in
hypoglycemic animals (the stimulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis by
glucagon, cortisol, epinephrine, and growth hormone) are not fully operational in ferrets with
insulinoma. A blood glucose value of <60 mg/dl in the absence of clinical signs or laboratory
abnormalities suggesting another cause for hyperglycemia is considered diagnostic.
Measurement of blood glucose should be performed on multi-test automated biochemistry
analyzers to avoid the wide variation of results that may be obtained by the use of hand-held
glucometers at low serum glucose values. Insulin levels may be measured, and are normal or
elevated in the presence of hypoglycemia. Some authors advocate the use of suggestive
clinical signs and intermittent hypoglycemia for diagnosis without measurement of serum
insulin values because these values may be normal in some ferrets with insulinoma. Definitive
diagnosis requires histologic examination of pancreatic nodules, which may be difficult to
detect without surgery. As noted above, initially medical management alone may be
sufficient to control clinical signs. Surgery generally does result in some amelioration of
clinical signs and/or improved medical management for 2-6 months after surgery. However,
surgical treatment is often not curative because of the frequent presence of microscopic
insulinomas that are not identified and removed.
