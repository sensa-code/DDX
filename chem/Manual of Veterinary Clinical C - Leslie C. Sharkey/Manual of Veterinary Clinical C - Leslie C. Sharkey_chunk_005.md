Marked elevation of ALT and AST: There is evidence for significant hepatocellular damage
with hepatocellular enzyme elevations of approximately 100x the upper limit of the reference
interval for both enzymes. Elevation of AST is less specific for liver and could indicate some
muscle damage. A CK might help distinguish the source of the AST but is not clinically
necessary in this case. Unfortunately, these enzyme elevations do not reveal the underlying
cause of the hepatocellular damage, nor are they prognostic.


Moderate elevation of ALP: The most likely cause of the approximately 10-fold increase in
ALP is mild cholestasis secondary to hepatocellular damage. This interpretation is supported
by the relatively greater elevation in hepatocellular enzymes compared to cholestatic
enzymes. Some degree of enzyme induction is possible, since we speculated about possible
elements of a corticosteroid leukogram. Some reference laboratories offer measurement of
the corticosteroid-induced ALP isoenzyme. As always, a complete drug history should be
taken and other extrahepatic causes of liver enzyme elevations should be ruled out,
especially in the dog (see Table 2-1).


Mild hyperbilirubinemia: The most likely cause for this finding is mild secondary cholestasis
and fits with the interpretation of the elevated ALP. Hemolysis or a significant destruction of
red blood cells appears unlikely in this case, given the normal hematocrit. Sepsis must be
considered as a contributor to hyperbilirubinemia in this patient due to the presence of
bacteria and inflammatory cells in the abdominal fluid. High levels of circulating inflammatory
cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor directly inhibit the uptake of
bilirubin by hepatocytes.


Increased anion gap: This is due to an increase in circulating anions that are not routinely
measured in the chemistry panel (see Chapter 7). In this case, lactic acid is likely
accumulating secondary to perfusion deficits in this dog. The fact that the bicarbonate is
within the reference interval despite the increased anion gap suggests a mixed acid/base
disorder. A complete understanding of the acid/base status of this patient would require
arterial blood gas analysis.


Abdominocentesis: Septic suppurative exudate (see Figure 2-2)

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Severe hepatocellular damage with secondary mild cholestasis and mild/moderate prerenal
azotemia, septic peritonitis.


Further investigation into the patient history revealed that the dog had been diagnosed with
a large hepatocellular carcinoma at another clinic. The blood work was normal at that time.
Twenty-four hours prior to presentation to the referral hospital, the liver tumor in the patient
had been treated by administration of 12-15, ultrasound guided, intratumoral injections of
100% ethanol. Wedge biopsy sections of the liver showed remnants of the original liver
tumor with areas of coagulation necrosis and acute suppurative portal hepatitis. The necrosis
was likely the result of the ethanol injections. The patient died in the hospital.


Liver Case 8 – Level 2
“Patton” is a 2.5-year-old, intact male German Shepherd dog who presented for vomiting
bile-tinged fluid, lethargy, and anorexia of 1 week duration. His condition had progressed to
stumbling, blindness, and collapse. At the time of presentation, Patton is in severe shock and
has a fever of 108°F. Abdominocentesis is collected with routine blood work.

etiologic agent is not present.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: Neutrophilic leukocytosis with lymphopenia and no morphologic abnormalities is
consistent with corticosteroid-induced changes in the leukogram, although monocytosis is
not present. Despite the absence of toxic changes or a left shift, inflammation is suspected in
addition to corticosteroid effects based on the remainder of the data.


Erythrogram: Mild normocytic normochromic anemia. Possibilities include anemia of chronic
disease (non-regenerative) or acute blood loss with insufficient time to produce a detectable


change in red blood cell indices. Acute hemolysis is also possible. There is some morphologic
evidence for an attempt at regeneration, including the increase in polychromasia and
nucleated RBCs. Nucleated RBC’s may be related to endothelial cell damage secondary to
shock, although splenic dysfunction is also possible. A reticulocyte count should be done and
successive CBC’s should be monitored as needed.


Platelets: The presence of platelet clumps suggests that the platelet count may be
artifactually low and should be repeated on a fresh sample. Such a mild thrombocytopenia is
not of the degree expected to result in spontaneous bleeding in the absence of other
pathology. Liver disease or severe inflammation could contribute to decreased platelets (the
mechanism is likely consumptive), and coagulation studies would help rule out the possibility
of disseminated intravascular coagulation.


Serum Biochemistry
Hypochloremia: In this patient, the hypochloremia is not accompanied by changes in serum
sodium. Vomiting of gastric contents causes loss of chloride, and the chloride tends to vary
inversely with bicarbonate (HCO3). (For full discussion of electrolyte evaluation, see Chapter 7)


Hypokalemia: Patton has several factors that could contribute to hypokalemia.
Gastrointestinal loss through vomiting and/or diarrhea is an important cause. Decreased intake
of potassium in anorectic patients can lead to hypokalemia, most often in combination with
external losses. Cellular translocation should always be considered as a cause of abnormal
potassium. The alkalemia in this patient could trigger a shift of potassium into the cells in
exchange for hydrogen ion. (For full discussion of electrolyte evaluation, see Chapter 7)


Increased HCO3: This value indicates alkalosis, again related to loss of acid through vomiting
of gastric contents.


Marked hyperbilirubinemia: The combination of dramatic elevations in ALP and GGT
supports cholestasis as the cause for this abnormality. Although the patient is anemic, the
decrement in hematocrit is small and there are no changes in RBC morphology to suggest a
hemolytic mechanism. As noted for Lady (Case 7), sepsis may also impair hepatocellular
uptake of bilirubin. Van den Burgh fractionation of bilirubin in small animal patients is not
considered a reliable marker for hemolytic versus cholestatic hyperbilirubinemia because of
rapid equilibration of the conjugated and unconjugated forms of bilirubin.


Marked increase in ALP and GGT: These elevations (roughly 35x and 4x the upper limit of
the reference interval) are secondary to significant cholestasis in this patient. As always,
contributions from extrahepatic causes of liver enzyme elevations must be considered.


Mild increase in ALT and AST: These elevations (roughly 5x the upper limit of the reference
interval) are mild compared to the increases in the cholestatic enzymes. Based on the relative
increases in enzymes, Patton likely has hepatocellular damage secondary to a primary
cholestatic process.


Hypercholesterolemia: Patton most likely has hypercholesterolemia secondary to cholestasis.
Hypercholesterolemia may also be seen in association with several endocrinopathies,
nephrotic syndrome, pancreatitis, liver disease, as a post-prandial finding, and idiopathic
hyperlipidemia.


Abdominocentesis: There is marked, mixed inflammation with pigment indicative of bile
peritonitis (See Figure 2-3).


###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Primary cholestasis with secondary hepatocellular damage. Electrolyte and acid/base
abnormalities consistent with vomiting. Bile peritonitis.


This case is in contrast to Lady (Case 7), in which hepatocellular damage was the primary
process as seen by the relatively greater elevation of hepatocellular enzymes versus
cholestatic enzymes. In addition to enzyme changes, the marked hyperbilirubinemia and
moderate hypercholesterolemia support a significant cholestatic process. In neither case do
we have available tests of liver function.


Abdominal radiographs of Patton showed free gas in the abdomen highlighting the gall
bladder. During exploratory surgery, an engorged necrotic gall bladder was seen and a
rupture was present at the liver border, explaining the bile peritonitis. Histologically the
perforation was accompanied by chronic suppurative inflammation and granulation tissue,
but the cause for the rupture could not be determined. A recent study reports that gall
bladder infarction may be a cause for ruptured gall bladder (Holt). Patients in that study had
similar clinicopathologic abnormalities to this patient. After surgery, Patton was treated with
multiple antibiotics and Reglan [®] . His clinical condition improved, however he remained blind
in the right eye despite normal papillary light reflexes. The blindness was interpreted to be
secondary to a central event, but the etiology was not investigated further.

Liver Case 9 – Level 2
“Bruja” is a 14-year-old spayed female German shepherd mixed breed dog presenting for
progressive anorexia, lethargy, and weakness. She has recently begun vomiting yellow-green,
clear fluid at least 3 times a day. Bruja was spayed at the age of 6 months and has had
intermittent drainage from the spay incision for the last 13 years that is antibiotic responsive.
On presentation, Bruja is nervous, but appears depressed. The abdomen is distended with
fluid and tender on palpation.

Cytologic description: 92% neutrophils, 8% large mononuclear cells.
Neutrophils are markedly degenerate and toxic, with foamy basophilic
cytoplasm and swollen poorly defined nuclei. Multiple large Döhle
bodies are present in many cells. Scattered foamy macrophages are
also present in a finely granular background containing occasional
erythrocytes. Small numbers of large pale rod shaped intracellular
bacteria are present.


Urine specific gravity: 1.039, other data not available

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: The mature neutrophilic leukocytosis with toxic change indicates inflammation.
The presence of a single mast cell is not diagnostically significant in this case.


Erythrogram: The mild normocytic hypochromic anemia is difficult to classify. Anemia of
chronic disease is nonregenerative, and usually normocytic normochromic. Rarely,
hypochromia may be seen with chronic inflammation as this represents an iron supply limiting
type of anemia. The hypochromia may also be associated with a mild or incipient
regenerative response or possible iron deficiency. A reticulocyte count could be performed
to evaluate marrow response to the anemia.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia with hyperphosphatemia: Considering the concentrated urine, the azotemia
should be classified as pre-renal. Anorexia and vomiting may be the cause of dehydration.


Hypoalbuminemia: The degree of hypoalbuminemia is mild. Third space loss of albumin into
the high protein abdominal effusion could contribute to hypoalbuminemia, although
concurrent renal and gastrointestinal losses must be considered. Because albumin is produced
by the liver, markedly decreased liver function could result in hypoalbuminemia, especially if
combined with abnormal losses. Given the liver enzyme elevations, serum bile acids should be
measured to evaluate liver function. Coagulation testing may be in order prior to any invasive
procedures. Albumin is also a negative acute phase rectant, so the inflammation may decrease
heptic production. Starvation can lead to hypoalbuminemia, but this patient’s body condition
appeared adequate and her history of anorexia was relatively acute.


Hypochloremia: In this case, the most likely cause of the mild hypochloremia with normal
serum sodium levels is loss by vomiting.


Hyperbilirubinemia: As always, hemolysis and liver disease are the main differential
diagnoses for hyperbilirubinemia. This patient is anemic, however she also has elevated liver
enzymes. Septic patients may have hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of either of these
conditions because endotoxin can directly impair hepatocellular uptake of bilirubin.
