Increased ALT and AST (2x and 6x): Hepatocellular damage is occurring concurrently with
cholestasis and could be secondary to the damaging effects of bile on the hepatocytes.


Increased amylase and lipase: Given the history of vomiting and diarrhea along with a high
fat diet, pancreatitis is possible. Clinicians should be aware, however, that decreased
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can result in increased amylase and lipase. Generally,
decreased GFR will cause relatively minor elevations in pancreatic enzymes, often 2-4x the
upper limit of the reference range.


###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Renal azotemia with cholestasis and hepatocellular damage, possible pancreatitis


As has been stated previously, the serum biochemical profile can rarely point to the specific
cause of liver disease. In this case, there is evidence of cholestasis and hepatocellular
damage, however the available laboratory indicators of liver function (blood ammonia,
coagulation times, serum albumin) are normal. The combination of renal azotemia and
elevated liver enzymes in canine patients should trigger the suspicion of leptospirosis in areas
where this disease occurs. Unlike dogs with leptospirosis, clinical signs are generally mild or
inapparent in infected cats, despite inflammation in the kidney and liver.


Initial leptospirosis titers for Hilda were negative, but convalescent titers were 1:6,400 for
_L. pomona_ and 1:1,600 for _L. bratislava_ . Titers are often negative during acute illness, and a
four fold or greater increase in titers support a diagnosis of leptospirosis. Replication of the
leptospire organism causes liver and kidney damage, and renal colonization can be long term.
In the liver, the toxins produced by the organisms may cause subcellular damage that is not
reflected by histologic changes. Intrahepatic cholestasis results from inflammation in the liver.


Hilda was hospitalized for several weeks for treatment for leptospirosis and for supportive
care while her renal function returned. She was discharged to the care of her referring
veterinarian.


Liver Case 19 – Level 3
“Lily” is a 7-year-old spayed female domestic short haired cat who presented with a one day
history of severe lethargy and anorexia. According to the owner, Lily is drinking a lot and has
been lying next to the water bowl. Her litter box was very wet this morning, but another cat
does share the litter box. Lily is an indoor cat that eats “strange” things such as lemon grass,
aloe, and pieces of plastic. The owner reports that she was normal until yesterday, with a
normal appetite and the cat has not lost weight. On physical examination, Lily was febrile,
icteric, and had a painful abdomen. A cranial abdominal mass was palpated.

Urinalysis: Not available

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: This patient is leukopenic with a left shift and toxic change characteristic of
marked inflammation. The lymphopenia suggests an overlapping stress leukogram.


Erythrogram: A mild normocytic normochromic anemia is compatible with a nonregenerative
anemia associated with chronic disease. A reticulocyte count should be performed to
quantify any regenerative response.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Differential diagnoses include stress hyperglycemia, post-prandial effects,
endocrinopathies such as diabetes mellitus or hyperthyroidism, or pancreatitis. Blood glucose
levels >300 mg/dl have been seen in stressed cats in the absence of diabetes mellitus, and
stress hyperglycemia may be exaggerated in sick cats (Rand). A urinalysis is not available, but
this degree of hyperglycemia may result in glucosuria regardless of the initiating cause.


Hypocalcemia:
Differentials for hypocalcemia associated with a normal serum albumin and normal
phosphorus concentrations include pancreatitis and malabsorption. Other causes of
hypocalcemia such as renal failure and hypoparathyroidism are usually, but not always,
associated with hyperphosphatemia. See Chapter 6 on calcium and phosphorus for a more
complete discussion of mineral metabolism.


Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Electrolyte abnormalities will be discussed more
thoroughly in Chapter 7. In this case, the hyponatremia likely reflects osmotic shifts in water
secondary to the hyperglycemia. Renal, cutaneous, and third space losses are possible.
Computation of a corrected chloride (111 mEq/L x 156 mEq/L ÷ 145 mEq/L = 119 mEq/L
chloride, within the reference interval) shows that changes in chloride are proportional to
changes in sodium and are also probably attributable to the fluid shifts.


Hypokalemia: Hypokalemia may reflect decreased intake in anorexic patients, or increased
losses via the kidney or gastrointestinal tract, or third space losses. Decreased intake is most
likely to result in hypokalemia in combination with some type of loss. In this patient, anorexia
and increased losses through polyuria are contributory. Transcellular shifts of potassium
secondary to acid/base abnormalities also will occur; acidosis may cause a shift of potassium
outside of the cell in exchange for hydrogen ion.


Hyperbilirubinemia: Major rule outs for hyperbilirubinemia include hepatobiliary disease and
hemolysis. In combination with the serum enzyme elevations, liver disease is strongly
suspected. The anemia here is mild and nonregenerative, suggesting that a clinically
significant hemolytic event is unlikely.


Increased ALP (5x): Potential causes for this elevation include cholestasis or
endocrinopathies such as diabetes mellitus or hyperthyroidism. As was discussed in Rover’s
case (Case 6), nonspecific elevations in ALP are rare in the cat, so increased ALP is always
considered significant. Increases in ALP secondary to diabetes mellitus usually are <500 IU/L,
as seen here. While hyperglycemia provides some evidence for diabetes mellitus, the hyperbilirubinemia indicates high potential for cholestasis. An increased ALP with normal GGT
should flag hepatic lipidosis as a potential differential diagnosis, however other liver diseases
cannot be ruled out.


Increased ALT and AST (2x and 10x): These enzymes indicate hepatocellular damage and
support similar differential diagnoses listed for increased ALP.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Hepatocellular injury and cholestasis; hyperglycemia; decreased electrolytes; inflammatory
disease with mild non-regenerative anemia.


Abdominal ultrasound of Lily revealed a mild abdominal effusion. The abdominal mass proved
to be an enlarged hypoechoic pancreas surrounded by bright peripancreatic fat. Lily was
diagnosed with pancreatitis, and this was interpreted to be the inflammatory focus that caused
the neutropenia with left shift and toxic changes. Lily was treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and insulin. An esophagotomy tube was placed for nutritional
support. A liver biopsy was recommended if her liver enzymes did not normalize. Unfortunately,
Lily was euthanized at her referring veterinarian’s practice a month later.


Serum liver enzyme concentrations are often increased in patients with pancreatitis, possibly
secondary to exposure of the liver to toxic byproducts of pancreatic inflammation or
secondary to ischemia. In cats with pancreatitis, hyperbilirubinemia may reflect severe
hepatocellular damage or intrahepatic or extrahepatic obstruction of bile flow.
Hyperglycemia can be secondary to hyperglucagonemia and stress, however, some cats are
transiently or permanently diabetic after developing pancreatitis due to damage to islet cells
in the pancreas. The hypocalcemia is also explained by pancreatitis. The mechanism resulting
in hypocalcemia secondary to pancreatitis is uncertain but may relate to saponification of
peripancreatic fat or increased calcium uptake by muscle. Because pancreatitis in cats is
frequently associated with non-pancreatic conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease,
diabetes mellitus, or neoplasia, interpretation of blood work can be complex in these cases
(Simpson). Because Lily never had a liver biopsy, the possibility of primary liver disease
cannot be ruled out, though the combination of pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus are
sufficient to explain her laboratory abnormalities.


This case should be compared with Rover (Case 6), the hyperthyroid cat with hyperglycemia
and elevated liver enzymes associated with hyperthyroidism. Lily’s hyperbilirubinemia helps
support more significant hepatic pathology than was expected for Rover. The normal amylase
in spite of ultrasound evidence for pancreatic disease should be noted in this case. Amylase
is a poor test for pancreatitis in cats, and cases of suspected pancreatitis should have
samples submitted for lipase or trypsin-like immunoreactivty (TLI) that will be discussed in
more detail in a later chapter.

Liver Case 20 – Level 3
“Calvin” is a 4-month-old neutered male ferret that presented for vomiting, anorexia, and
lethargy. His owner reports that Calvin is drinking more, and his abdomen appears painful
when he is held. He has previously been healthy. On presentation, Calvin is recumbent and is
non-responsive until picked up. He appears weak, and has urinated on himself in the carrier.
He has pale mucous membranes and does appear painful in his abdomen on palpation.
Ausculation is within normal limits.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Not available


Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia: Complete interpretation of the significance of this finding requires a urine specific
gravity, which is not available. Pre-renal and renal azotemia are most likely since the ferret is
urinating. It should be noted that serum creatinine is even less sensitive an indicator of renal
dysfunction in ferrets than it is in dogs and cats, and this value will rarely exceed 2.0 or 3.0,
even in ferrets with histologic evidence of end stage renal failure.


Hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia: _This combination of abnormalities may be present_
_in patients with renal failure, although primary hypoparathyroidism and nutritional secondary_
_hyperparathyroidism are possible._ The hyperphosphatemia is attributable to decreased


glomerular filtration rate (GFR), while the hypocalcemia may be exacerbated by the hypoalbuminemia. Because a fraction of serum calcium is complexed with albumin, hypoalbuminemia may lead to decreases in total serum calcium, while ionized calcium will often be
normal. Formulas generated for correction of serum calcium for low albumin have been
generated for the dog, but cannot be extrapolated to other species.


Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia and normal globulin: In general, this pattern may
be seen with increased losses of protein via the kidney or secondary to decreased production
of albumin by the liver. It is not possible to evaluate renal losses without a urine sample.
Decreased total protein is a common finding in sick or geriatric ferrets, primarily as a
reflection of prolonged anorexia or inflammation in the bowel.


Hypochloremia and hyperkalemia: Low chloride may reflect losses due to vomiting.
Decreased GFR may lead in impaired renal excretion of potassium. Transcellular shifts may
occur with acid/base abnormalities, although the HCO3 is within reference range.
Hypochloremia and hyperkalemia may be seen with hypoadrenocorticism, however adrenal
disease in ferrets is generally secondary to a hyperfunctional gland rather than a
hypofunctional one.


Hyperbilirubinemia, increased ALP (mild) with marked increase in ALT and AST
(approximately 10x): The relatively greater elevation in hepatocellular enzymes compared to
cholestatic enzymes suggests hepatocellular insult as the primary process, with mild
secondary cholestasis. With the exception of liver tumors, primary hepatic disease is rare in
ferrets (Hoefer). Anorexia, with resultant mobilization of fat stores to the liver, will cause
hepatocellular swelling and increased liver enzymes in ferrets, however the increase in ALT
seen in this patient is somewhat greater than the increases of up to 800 IU/L that have been
noted in anoretic ferrets. The potential for toxicity should always be considered because of
the mischevious nature of ferrets.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Hepatocellular damage with mild secondary cholestasis, azotemia, and hypoproteinemia.


Possible differential diagnoses in this ferret include gastritis and ulceration, renal failure,
ingestion of a gastrointestinal foreign body with prerenal azotemia, hepatic neoplasia, and
toxicity. Further inquiry into the history of this patient revealed that the owner had found a
fragment of a 200 mg tablet of ibuprofen on the floor of her apartment the evening of onset
of clinical signs. Due to their curious nature, ferrets can be at risk for exposure to toxins, and
they have been known to pry tops off of bottles of medication or to chew open containers.


While the pharmacologic properties of ibuprofen have not been thoroughly studied in the
ferret, acute renal insufficiency, liver disease, and hypoalbuminemia have been reported in
human cases of ibuprofen intoxication. Ibuprofen inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, and can
decrease renal blood flow and GFR. Renal and gastrointestinal signs dominate in dogs with
ibuprofen toxicity, while very high doses may result in central nervous system signs. This
ferret presented with decreased mentation. A recent study of ibuprofen ingestion in ferrets
reported that 93% of affected animals had neurologic signs, while 55% had gastrointestinal
signs such as anorexia, vomiting, gagging, diarrhea or melena (Richardson). Signs of renal
insufficiency were also reported. Ferrets appear to be even more sensitive to the toxic effects
of ibuprofen than are cats.
