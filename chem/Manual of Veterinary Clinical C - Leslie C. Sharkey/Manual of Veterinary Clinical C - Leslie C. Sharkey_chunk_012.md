Calvin was treated with intravenous fluids and gastroprotectants. After one day of therapy, his
mentation improved and he began eating and drinking, but he was still weak when handled.
After 2 days of therapy, he was bright and responsive and no longer had pain on abdominal
palpation. By days three and four after presentation, Calvin’s laboratory work began to
normalize, indicating an improving prognosis. He was discharged on the fourth day, with
instructions to have his blood work rechecked in 2 weeks. Calvin had an uneventful recovery.

Liver Case 21 – Level 3
“Snoopy” is a 6-year-old spayed female Bassett cross who presents with an eight day history
of diarrhea. No blood has been noticed in the stools, and there has been no change in
appetite or behavior. Four days ago, the diarrhea worsened to a liquid consistency with
mucus. Since then, she has been lethargic. Two days ago, Snoopy appeared to have labored
breathing, and she regurgitated once last night. On physical examination, Snoopy is febrile
and has a distended abdomen.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Snoopy has leukopenia with a neutropenia, a borderline normocytic normochromic
anemia, and an apparent thrombocytopenia. A manual platelet count is recommended to
quantitate the low count. Sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation may cause the
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and prolonged coagulation times. If extramarrow causes of
the pancytopenia are not found, a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be considered to
investigate this problem.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: Sample handling should always be considered a possible cause of
hypoglycemia secondary to continuing consumption of glucose by cells in unspun blood
samples. There are many other less common causes of hypoglycemia. In this patient, liver
failure is a likely cause of true hypoglycemia. This interpretation is supported by multiple
other laboratory abnormalities compatible with liver dysfunction including hypoalbuminemia,
hyperbilirubinemia, elevated liver enzymes and hyperammonemia. Sepsis could be an issue
given the neutropenia and suggestion of disseminated intravascular coagulation (thrombocytopenia with prolonged clotting times). Paraneoplastic hypoglycemia should be considered in
this patient as well if there is evidence of organomegaly or mass lesions.


Hyperproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia and hyperglobulinemia: Mechanisms for hypoalbuminemia may include decreased hepatic production, increased losses through the gut,
kidney, third space or cutaneous lesions and/or secondary to malnutrition/starvation. Because
only approximately one third of liver function is required to maintain production of albumin,
impaired hepatic function will more readily result in hypoalbuminemia if there is concurrent
protein loss. In Lucy’s case, decreased production by a poorly functioning liver is possibly
compounded by losses through the gastrointestinal tract as a result of diarrhea. Albumin
production by the liver will also be decreased if there is hyperglobulinemia, possibly as a
compensatory change during an acute phase inflammatory response. Hyperglobulinemia can
be seen associated with increased production of acute phase reactants by the liver during
inflammation, by increased production of immunoglobulins secondary to antigenic
stimulation, or by autonomous antibody production by neoplastic lymphocytes or plasma
cells. Serum protein electrophoresis may be performed to distinguish reactive hyperglobulinemia (usually polyclonal) from paraneoplastic hyperglobulinemia (usually monoclonal).
Polyclonal gammopathy has been reported in canine and feline patients with chronic liver
disease, possibly related to decreased Kupffer cell function. This leads to increased exposure
of the body to antigens normally cleared from the portal blood. The development of
autoantibodies has also been described in association with chronic liver disease. In Snoopy,
the decrease in albumin combined with the marked increase in globulins resulted in a low
A:G ratio.


Mild hypochloremia and hypokalemia: These electrolyte changes are attributable to
gastrointestinal losses, and possibly decreased intake of potassium secondary to anorexia.


Hyperbilirubinemia: In the absence of evidence for hemolysis, the mild hyperbilirubinemia
supports a diagnosis of liver disease. The relatively greater increases in ALT and AST
compared to ALP support severe hepatocellular damage rather than primary cholestatic
disease. In this case, hyperbilirubinemia may occur secondary to hepatocellular swelling with
blocking of canaliculi or failure by damaged hepatocytes to clear and process bilirubin. In this
case, it is likely a combination of both mechanisms. Impaired bilirubin uptake by hepatocytes
secondary to the effect of endotoxin also may play a role.


Increased ALP (mild, 125% of normal): In combination with the hyperbilirubinemia and
elevations of other liver enzymes, cholestasis is probably the cause of the elevation in ALP.


Increased ALT and AST: The 15-20 fold increases in these enzymes are compatible with
significant hepatocellular damage, and are more significant than the mild increase in ALP.


Coagulation profile: There is prolongation of both the PT and APTT, supporting significant
impairment of secondary hemostasis. Failure to produce coagulation factors may occur
secondary to significant hepatic parenchymal loss. Given the thrombocytopenia, the potential
for DIC should be considered. This coagulopathy will have to be addressed prior to any
biopsy procedures.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Hepatocellular damage and decreased liver function


Snoopy was treated with fresh frozen plasma to help normalize her clotting factors, and was
given antibiotics due to her fever and neutropenia. Further diagnostic tests included a liver
aspirate and bone marrow aspirate. Many large lymphoblasts mixed with small clusters of
vacuolated hepatocytes were seen on the cytology of her liver aspirate (see Figure 2-8). Her
bone marrow aspirate included many hypercellular particles, consisting of 66% large
lymphoblasts similar to those seen in the liver aspirate. Lucy had granulocytic, erythroid, and
megakaryocytic hypoplasia. Cytology of the liver and bone marrow were consistent with a
diagnosis of lymphoma.


Lucy underwent chemotherapy for her lymphoma, and her liver function transiently improved.
She remained persistently neutropenic and intermittently was thrombocytopenic and/or
anemic. After two months of therapy, Lucy was euthanized after developing abdominal pain
and effusion, respiratory distress, and anorexia.


In this case, diffuse infiltration of the liver by neoplastic cells resulted in impaired liver
function. Clinical pathology findings associated with either primary or metastatic neoplasia of
the liver are quite variable and do not show a consistent pattern. Some patients present with
multiple laboratory abnormalities associated with liver disease, while others may have
completely normal blood work. Because serum biochemical data rarely leads to a specific
classification of the liver disease, liver cytology or preferably biopsy is required to establish
the presence of neoplasia.

Overview
Step 1: For many cases, extrahepatic processes were the primary or secondary cause of
laboratory abnormalities that are compatible with liver disease. Bone growth (Case 1),
neoplasia (Case 3), muscle damage (Cases 2, 4, 15, 17), drug treatment (Case 5),
endocrinopathy (Case 6), hypoxia/hypotension (Cases 2, 13, 15), and other gastrointestinal
disease (Case 19) were represented in these case studies. Always consider extrahepatic
causes of laboratory abnormalities that may suggest hepatobiliary disease.


Step 2: Using laboratory indicators, categorize the patient as having significant
hepatocellular damage (Cases 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21), cholestasis
(Cases 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21) or decreased liver function (Cases 10,
11, 12, 15, 17, 21). Please note the significant overlap; many patients have more than one
process occurring in the diseased liver.


Step 3: Using the relative increases in laboratory parameters that indicate hepatocellular
damage (Case 7, 21), cholestasis (Case 8, 16) and decreased liver function (Case 12), attempt
to prioritize which process is likely to be the primary issue. This is not possible in all cases
(Cases 9, 10, 11, 13, 19).


Step 4: For ALL of these cases, information in addition to what could be obtained from routine
laboratory work alone was required for specific diagnosis and treatment of patients. In almost
all cases, the history and physical were strong indicators of the cause of disease (Cases 1, 2, 4,
5, 7, 15, 20), while many required additional laboratory testing (Cases 6, 7, 18), imaging studies
(Cases 3, 9, 12, 19), and/or cytology/biopsy (Cases 3, 8, 11, 14, 16, 21). This reinforces the
concept that laboratory data must be interpreted within the context of clinical information.

##### Tests of the Gastrointestinal System and Carbohydrate Metabolism


The serum biochemical profile includes the measurement of multiple analytes that assist with
the diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease, including pancreatic enzymes, cholesterol,
triglycerides, and glucose. As we saw in the chapter on liver enzymes, diseases of other organ
systems also may cause abnormal results for these tests. Many metabolic and endocrine
disorders may influence parameters that are included in this section. In addition, significant
gastrointestinal disease may occur in a patient with normal laboratory data. Specific diagnosis
of gastrointestinal disease often requires additional specialty laboratory testing that is not
performed as part of the routine biochemical profile (for example, trypsin-like immunoreactivity or cobalamine/Vitamin B12 levels). As always, other diagnostic modalities such as
imaging studies and cytology or biopsy are often required for confirmation of diagnosis.


Guidelines for Interpretation of Serum Amylase and Lipase
1. Pancreatitis should be ruled out in patients with increased serum amylase or lipase, however
the sensitivity and specificity of these tests for pancreatic disease are not optimal. The degree
of enzyme elevation does not correlate with the severity of histologic changes in the pancreas.


2. Decreased glomerular filtration rate can increase the serum amylase and lipase up to two
to three times the upper limit of the reference range.


3. Dexamethasone treatment may increase serum lipase concentrations. In contrast, serum
amylase may decrease in healthy dogs treated with corticosteroids (Williams).


4. Serum amylase and lipase may increase with extrapancreatic pathology, including intestinal
and hepatic disease.


5. Neither serum amylase nor lipase is a good indicator of pancreatitis in cats (Gerhardt).


6. Serum and abdominal fluid amylase and lipase are frequently increased in New World
camelids presenting for pancreatic necrosis (Pearson).


7. Pancreatitis is rare in cattle and horses. Serum and abdominal fluid amylase and lipase may
be elevated, however these values also may be increased secondary to enteritis.


8. As was described for serum liver enzyme levels, amylase and lipase values that fall below
the reference range are not considered clinically significant and do not indicate pancreatic
insufficiency.


The interpretation of cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose is much more complex than that
of the pancreatic enzymes.


Interpretation of Serum Cholesterol
1. There are many causes of hypercholesterolemia.


2. Some drugs may alter serum cholesterol levels (L-asparaginase, azathioprine, corticosteroids, methimazole, and others) so a careful medication history should be taken.


3. Hypocholesterolemia is not common and may occur secondary to hypoadrenocorticism,
protein-losing enteropathy, severe prolonged liver failure, or malnutrition.

Interpretation of Serum Triglycerides
1. Increased serum triglycerides cause a milky appearance to the serum or plasma (lipemia).
Increased serum cholesterol will not do this.


2. Post-prandial effects are the most common cause of elevated triglycerides and should
always be ruled out first.


3. Causes for hypertriglyceridemia are similar to those listed above for hypercholesterolemia.


4. Only rarely have drugs been reported to influence serum triglyceride levels.


5. Idiopathic syndromes associated with hyperlipidemia (hyperlipidemia is either increased
cholesterol and/or triglycerides) have been reported.


6. Low serum triglycerides are generally not considered clinically important.


Interpretation of Serum Glucose
A note on methodology: Although the focus of this manual is on interpretation of data rather
than the technical aspects of assays, the use of small, portable glucometers is common and
therefore worth mentioning. There are many types of these analyzers, and a thorough review
is beyond this chapter; however recent research has shown that data from these glucometers
appears to slightly underestimate glucose levels determined by reference methods in most
cases. The differences are most often small, and not clinically significant, but are greatest at
very high blood glucose concentrations. The interested reader is referred to several articles
(Wess and Reusch, Wess, and Cohn).
