6. Low serum triglycerides are generally not considered clinically important.


Interpretation of Serum Glucose
A note on methodology: Although the focus of this manual is on interpretation of data rather
than the technical aspects of assays, the use of small, portable glucometers is common and
therefore worth mentioning. There are many types of these analyzers, and a thorough review
is beyond this chapter; however recent research has shown that data from these glucometers
appears to slightly underestimate glucose levels determined by reference methods in most
cases. The differences are most often small, and not clinically significant, but are greatest at
very high blood glucose concentrations. The interested reader is referred to several articles
(Wess and Reusch, Wess, and Cohn).


Hypoglycemia
1. Always rule out artifactual hypoglycemia first, especially if the patient does not appear
to have clinical signs associated with hypoglycemia. Serum or plasma should be separated
from cells within 30 minutes of sample collection to avoid consumption of glucose by cells


within the sample. High leukocyte or platelet counts in the blood may accelerate the
consumption of glucose within the sample. Collection of samples into tubes containing
sodium fluoride will prevent consumption of glucose by the cells.


2. Sepsis is a common cause of hypoglycemia.


3. Various neoplasms will cause excessive uptake of glucose by tissues due to the production
of abnormal insulin like growth factors (mesenchymal, epithelial, or hematopoietic tumors;
especially large tumors occurring in the chest or abdomen) or the production of insulin (beta
cell tumors).


4. Hypoglycemia may occur with hepatic insufficiency as a result of impaired gluconeogenesis
and/or failure to clear insulin.


5.Juvenile hypoglycemia is seen in pigs or small breed dogs due to impaired gluconeogenesis.


6. Less common causes of hypoglycemia are starvation, malabsorption, or glycogen storage
diseases.


Hyperglycemia
1. Post-prandial effects may result in mild hyperglycemia just as they can contribute to
increased cholesterol and triglycerides.


2. Stress (corticosteroid effects) and excitement (epinephrine release) will increase serum
glucose concentrations. Increases in serum glucose related to stress may overlap with those
observed in diabetes mellitus, especially in cats (Rand), and can potentially result in glucosuria.
Sympathoadrenal response to head trauma can also result in hyperglycemia (Syring).


3. Diabetes mellitus is an important cause of hyperglycemia, but must be differentiated from
the previous two common causes.


4. Administration of corticosteroids or dextrose containing solutions will increase blood glucose.


5. Endocrinopathies such as hyperadrenocorticism and hyperthyroidism can be associated
with hyperglycemia.


6. Some drugs, such as xylazine, may cause hyperglycemia. This is an important consideration
if a difficult patient must be anesthetized to obtain a blood sample.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: All parameters are within normal limits.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypertriglyceridemia: In a healthy patient with no other abnormalities evident on physical


examination, history, or laboratory testing, elevated triglycerides most likely signifies postprandial effects or idiopathic hyperlipidemia.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Gilligan’s owners were instructed to fast him overnight prior to the collection of the blood
sample; however their 6-year-old son had fed the dog a large can of dog food three hours
prior to the appointment. A serum biochemical profile performed on a fasted blood sample
the next day did not contain laboratory abnormalities.


Hyperlipidemia is a general term used to describe the presence of excess lipid (cholesterol or
triglycerides) in the blood. Only increased serum triglyceride concentrations cause
hyperlipemia, which imparts the milky appearance to serum or plasma (Figure 3-1).
Hypercholesterolemia may cause a slight haziness, but not the marked turbidity that is seen
with increased triglycerides. Note the difference between hyperlipidemia and hyperlipemia:
hyperlipemic samples are hyperlipidemic, but not all hyperlipidemic samples are
hyperlipemic. Occasionally samples that are hyperlipidemic based on serum cholesterol
and/or triglyceride measurements have a normal gross appearance.


The most common cause of lipemia in the dog is post-prandial effects. An eight to ten hour
fast should be sufficient to clear the blood of lipids. Serum triglycerides may be significantly
elevated after eating, however the increase in cholesterol is generally mild and often remains
within the upper limit of the reference range. Patients with fasting hyperlipidemia should be
evaluated for causes of secondary hyperlipidemia such as pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus,
hypothyroidism, cholestasis, hypoadrenocorticism, and nephrotic syndrome. If hyperlipidemia
is persistent despite fasting, and there is no evidence of concurrent diseases that elevate
lipids, then primary idiopathic hyperlipidemia should be considered. Idiopathic
hyperlipidemia is most commonly seen in miniature schnauzers and beagles, but occasionally
has been reported in other breeds as well as mixed breed dogs.


The transport of lipids in the blood requires that they be associated with proteins to enhance
solubility. These lipid protein complexes vary in size, density, electrical charge, composition,
and metabolic function. The relative proportions of different types of complexes can be
characterized by density centrifugation, electrophoretic mobility, chromatography, or
chemical precipitation. These methods are not often available to the general practitioner, and
more research is required before these tests are likely to be widely applied in clinical
veterinary practice.

GI Case 2 – Level 1
“Marmalade” is a 15-year-old neutered male domestic short haired cat presenting for a
routine check up and blood work. He has had slight weight loss since his last visit to the clinic
two years ago. He occasionally has problems with hair-balls, and has recently seemed to have
some difficulty eating dry cat food. His owner thinks he has a “bad tooth.” Marmalade is
crying and snarling in his carrier, and is swatting at you through the windows. When the
carrier is opened, he defecates and urinates on the table and, to get to the point, requires
general anesthesia for examination and phlebotomy. On physical examination, Marmalade
does have an abscessed canine tooth, but the physical examination is otherwise normal.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: This patient has a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis, a mature lymphocytosis, and a
monocytosis. The neutrophilia could be secondary to inflammation, epinephrine release or
corticosteroid effects, however a lymphopenia would be expected in response to corticosteroids. The concurrent monocytosis indicates that inflammation from the abscessed tooth
may be the cause. The lymphocytosis may occur secondary to antigenic stimulation. Given
the circumstances of the clinic visit and absence of reactive morphologic changes, an
epinephrine induced lymphocytosis is also possible.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Based on the history, the primary rule out for hyperglycemia should be
stress. Anesthesia can result in epinephrine release as well. Xylazine is a commonly used
sedative/analgestic that interferes with insulin release and may result in a transient
hyperglycemia which may be severe enough to cause a glucosuria. Post-prandial effects may
be ruled out by determining the time of the last meal but are less likely with high protein,
low carbohydrate cat foods. (Note that in Case 1, Gilligan had recently eaten, but had blood
glucose levels within the reference interval) Diabetes remains on the list of differential
diagnoses, however there is little support for this diagnosis based on clinical signs or
laboratory data. Other laboratory abnormalities often associated with diabetes such as
glucosuria, hypercholesterolemia, and elevated liver enzymes are absent.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Marmalade’s hyperglycemia was caused by a combination of stress and anesthesia. In some
cases, repeat sampling when the cat is less stressed, or having the owner obtain blood at home
will result in normal blood glucose determinations (Casella, Reusch). In Marmalade’s case,
however, any degree of handling with medical intent was not well received. The absence of
glucosuria is helpful here, however stress induced hyperglycemia may result in blood glucose
concentrations that exceed the renal threshold for reabsorption (approximately 200 mg/dl) for
extended periods of time in anxious cats. A recent report showed that some healthy stressed
cats had blood glucose concentrations in the diabetic range for as long as 90-120 minutes after
the stressor (Rand).


The serum fructosamine test is available to help discriminate stress-induced hyperglycemia from
diabetes mellitus. Serum fructosamine levels reflect the amount of plasma proteins that have
undergone irreversible, non-enzymatic glycation in the presence of hyperglycemia.
Fructosamine concentration is proportional to the blood glucose concentration over the life of
the proteins in the serum, thus averaging the blood glucose concentration over the preceeding
few weeks in the patient. This is a great advantage over blood glucose concentrations, which
reflect only the immediate situation and may be altered by numerous variables. Serum
fructosamine has been shown to be a useful test for differentiating stress hyperglycemia from
diabetes and could be performed in patients where the clinical history and physical exam make
this distinction less clear (Crenshaw).

“Gretchen” is a 12-year-old spayed female Cocker Spaniel presenting for head shaking. On
physical exam, Gretchen has seborrhea and yeasty smelling ears, which are sensitive to
manipulation. She also has significant dental disease. Gretchen’s physical examination is
otherwise normal. Routine blood work is performed prior to administering anesthesia to
clean her teeth and ears.
