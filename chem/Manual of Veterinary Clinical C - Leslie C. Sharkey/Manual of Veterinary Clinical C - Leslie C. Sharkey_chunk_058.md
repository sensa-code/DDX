Increased AST, LDH, and CK: The increased AST and LDH could be compatible with liver
disease. Intestinal disease alone can cause secondary hepatic pathology because portal blood
delivers high quantities of bacteria, bacterial toxins, and inflammatory mediators to the liver.
These enzymes are not liver specific and also may originate from muscle. Since the bilirubin,
ALP, and GGT are within reference intervals and the elevated CK suggests muscle damage,
liver disease may not be present. Muscle damage may be the result of poor perfusion
secondary to dehydration and sepsis, hypoxemia secondary to respiratory disease, or muscle
injury during transportation or with intramuscular injections.


Tracheal wash: This is compatible with septic suppurative inflammation.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Glamor was treated with intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and topical ophthalmic medications. Her
eye lesions did not respond to medical therapy, and the cornea eventually perforated and was
treated surgically. Glamor’s condition remained critical with decreasing serum protein levels, so
total parenteral nutrition was instituted along with plasma transfusions. Her breathing and
azotemia were improving with treatment, but several days later, Glamor began to bleed
excessively from venipuncture sites. Her coagulation times were within reference intervals, but
she was thrombocytopenic. Glamor died later that day. On necropsy, Glamor had multiple
pulmonary abscesses, severe small intestinal enteritis, and ulcerative colitis. Multiple foci of
necrosis were noted in both kidneys, compatible with the clinical suspicion of acute renal failure.


Multiple cases of renal failure in various species have been presented in previous chapters and
can be compared with Glamor. In particular, the calcium and phosphorus data can be contrasted
with Nevada (Case 9), who experienced temporary exacerbation of more chronic renal failure.
Glamor’s hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia is more compatible with acute renal disease in
horses, while Nevada’s low-normal phosphorus and hypercalcemia is characteristic of chronic
renal failure. Nevada’s pattern is repeated in Margarite (Chapter 5, Case 9). Horses in this book
suspected of having pre-renal azotemia (Case 8 and Chapter 5, Case 19) had hyperphosphatemia and normal to high total serum calcium. The presence of concentrated urine is
important in differentiating chronic renal failure from pre-renal azotemia. Dietary content of
calcium may also influence the serum calcium data in patients with compromised renal function.


Overview
The regulation of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium is very complex and diseases of
many unrelated systems can influence the data.


Step 1: In the absence of clinical signs, it is recommended to verify any abnormal value by
repeat measure. Rule out artifacts, such as collection of the sample in EDTA or the
occasional spurious hypophosphatemia of unknown origin that is not repeatable with
resampling (Case 1).


Step 2: Evaluate the serum protein level. Increases or decreases in serum protein may
influence total serum calcium or magnesium values because of protein binding (Case 7, 10,
13, 16, 17, 18).


Step 3: Consider the effects of age or reproductive status. Young animals may have
increased serum calcium or phosphorus associated with bone growth; this is sometimes
associated with increased ALP. Bone remodeling for other reasons including infectious
disease and neoplasia may cause similar changes in older animals. The demands of fetal
development or lactation may lower serum calcium (Case 2 and Chapter 2, Case 1).


Step 4: Evaluate the patient for evidence of renal disease. The effects of renal disease on
calcium and phosphorus levels vary with the type of renal disease and species. In general,
phosphorus will increase with decrements in glomerular filtration rate (Case 8), while changes
in total and ionized calcium are less predictable, especially in small animal species. In horses,
chronic renal failure is often associated with hypercalcemia with or without hypophosphatemia (Case 9), while acute renal failure is more likely to be characterized by
hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia (Case 17). Cats with urethral obstruction also
sometimes have hypocalcemia (Chapter 5, Case 7). In some cases, hypercalcemia may be the
cause rather than the result of renal dysfunction (Case 6, 7, 14). In other cases, intoxication
(ethylene glycol) may cause both renal disease and abnormalities of calcium and phosphorus
(Case 12). Protein losing nephropathy can be associated with hypocalcemia because of
hypoalbuminemia (see Step 2).


Step 5: Consider the effects of gastrointestinal or pancreatic disease. Both colic in horses
and pancreatitis in small animal patients can cause hypocalcemia and may be associated with
pre-renal changes in glomerular filtration rate that influence phosphorus homeostasis
(Chapter 5, Case 19). Diseases that alter gastrointestinal permeability can also influence
calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium homeostasis (Case 17).


Step 6: Consider the potential for parathyroid disease. Primary hypoparathyroidism should
be considered if there is true ionized hypocalcemia that cannot be attributed to another
cause. Measurement of parathyroid hormone (PTH) can be helpful (Case 3). Primary hyperparathyroidism should be considered if other causes of ionized hypercalcemia are ruled out.
Evaluation of the neck for the presence of masses in the area of the parathyroid gland helps
to confirm this diagnosis (Case 5).


Step 7: Evaluate the patient for extra-parathyroid endocrinopathies that can alter calcium
and phosphorus. Feline hyperthyroidism can increase serum phosphorus, and adrenal
disease can alter total serum calcium (Case 13). Some malignant neoplasms produce PTHrP
or other factors that can cause hypercalcemia (Case 14).


Step 8: Determine if there is a cause for cellular translocation of phosphorus. Cytoplasmic
levels of phosphorus are high, and may leak from injured or necrotic tissue (Case 4, 15).
Alternatively, phosphorus may translocate into cells due to the action of insulin (Case 16).

##### Electrolyte and Acid/Base Evaluation


General Background
The regulation of electrolyte and acid/base balance is extremely complex. While a few basic
mechanisms clearly influence this balance, it may be very difficult to determine the exact
cause for an abnormality in an individual patient when multiple or complex disorders are
present. Some pathophysiologic mechanisms reported in the veterinary medical literature
appear to be species specific or are extrapolated from the human literature with no
documentation of their significance in domestic animal species. Therefore, some of the
mechanisms for abnormalities in the cases that follow may be somewhat speculative. As we
have seen with many other analytes, the interpretation of indicators of electrolyte and
acid/base status is dependent on history, physical examination findings, and other clinical
laboratory data. It may be impossible to say with certainty what electrolyte abnormalities
accompany a particular condition because of the influence of so many variables, including
food intake, duration and severity of disease, or effects of treatment. Multiple examples of
some entities are included in this chapter to demonstrate the variability of clinical chemistry
abnormalities in patients with the same primary diagnosis.


Electrolyte concentrations in the blood reflect the electrolyte content of the extracellular fluid
and do not accurately reflect intracellular content or total body stores of that electrolyte.
Serum electrolyte values are the sum of gains and losses from the gastrointestinal tract,
kidney, skin, third space (body cavities and interstitium), and intracellular space. In addition,
serum electrolyte concentrations are influenced by the addition or loss of free water from the
vascular space, so they should be interpreted in the context of the hydration status of the
patient. For example, a bleeding patient proportionately loses both water and electrolytes,
so initially the serum electrolyte values will be normal despite volume depletion in the
intravascular space. Compensatory water retention by the kidney and increased thirst
(presuming the patient is drinking water) may transiently dilute the remaining serum sodium
until other mechanisms replace the needed electrolyte. The packed cell volume and total
protein may provide additional information about free water balance, however primary or
secondary disease processes may influence the production and/or losses of erythrocytes and
protein. In some cases, multiple abnormalities combine to result in a normal value, which may
mask underlying pathologic changes.


Acid/base status may be evaluated using parameters on the routine serum biochemical
profile. HCO3, anion gap, and chloride can give information about acid/base status, but in
some cases, a blood gas analysis will be required for further evaluation. Acid/base and
electrolyte regulation are interconnected, so the data should be interpreted as an integrated
whole. Patients with gastrointestinal and/or renal disease are particularly likely to have
acid/base and electrolyte abnormalities because of the central roles of these organs in the
uptake and elimination of these analytes. A complete discussion of the physiology of
electrolyte and acid/base biochemistry is beyond the scope of this book, and the reader is
encouraged to review any of the several excellent texts included in the recommended
resources section prior to working the cases in this chapter.


Sodium
Sodium is the major cation in the extracellular fluid, including the serum. Sodium is often
used by the body to drive cellular transport systems and water reabsorption. Serum sodium
may be measured either by ion specific electrode or flame photometry. Ion specific electrode
measurements are preferred because they less likely to be affected by the presence of
hyperlipidemia or hyperproteinemia, which may artifactually depress electrolyte
measurements performed using flame photometry. With direct potentiometric methods using
ion specific electrodes, there is no dilution of the samples and lipemic interference with
measurement of electrolyte concentrations is not anticipated. However, if an analyzer
employs indirect potentiometry with ion specific electrodes in which the sample is diluted as


part of the assay, artifactual lowering of electrolyte concentrations may be observed with
severe lipemia. If both sodium and chloride are decreased in an obviously lactescent sample,
another methodology should be used to confirm concentrations of these electrolytes. This
underscores the need to be familiar with the laboratory that you use to run your samples.


As referred to above, serum sodium concentration reflects the ratio of sodium to water in the
vascular space and so may be affected by alterations in free water balance independent of
real changes in total body sodium. Likewise, proportional loss of both water and sodium will
result in normal serum sodium concentrations despite dehydration and low total body
sodium. Serum sodium is primarily regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
and by regulation of plasma osmolality via central mechanisms including release of
antidiuretic hormone.

Chloride
Like sodium, there is abundant chloride in the extracellular fluid, while there is a smaller amount
in the intracellular space dependent on the resting potential of the cell. Chloride is the principal
anion filtered by the glomeruli and participates in acid/base balance in addition to being an
important regulator of osmolality. Like sodium, movement of chloride across membranes can
drive transcellular transport. In many patients, changes in serum chloride will mirror
proportional changes in sodium based on gains and losses or fluid shifts. When there is a
disproportionate change in chloride, acid/base status should be evaluated. To determine if the
change in chloride is proportional to that of sodium, a corrected chloride can be calculated
using the formula (Cl [-] )corrected=(Cl [-] ) x midrange normal sodium/(Na [+] ). In uncomplicated acid/base
disorders, chloride will often vary inversely with the serum bicarbonate (also an anion). If this is
not the case, a mixed acid base disorder should be suspected. Methodologic considerations
are similar to those described for sodium. Additionally, bromide from potassium bromide may
be measured as chloride by some analyzers resulting in artifactual increases in CI [-] .


Hyperchloremia

may be inappropriate


Hypochloremia

2. With a disproportionate change in sodium, consider acid/base disorder, sequestration or
diuretic use.


Potassium
Potassium is the major intracellular cation, however serum levels are approximately
equivalent to the extracellular fluid concentration, which is much lower. Therefore, the
majority of potassium is in the cell and is not routinely measured, making serum potassium
concentration a poor indicator of total body potassium. Potassium is required for the normal
function of many enzymes and is critical in generating the normal resting cell membrane
potential. Some clinical signs associated with hyper- and hypokalemia are the result of altered
membrane excitability because of changes in the resting potential of cells. Like sodium and
chloride, serum potassium may be measured using ion specific electrode or flame
photometry methods. Also like the other electrolytes, the serum potassium level reflects the
sum of intake and loss, however serum potassium concentration is further modulated by
transcellular shifts. This is quantitatively more important than with the other electrolytes
because of its predominantly intracellular location. Intracellular shifts of potassium can be
triggered by insulin and catecholamines, while tissue damage can result in the release of
intracellular potassium. Inorganic acidosis associated with some types of diarrhea or renal
disease may cause hyperkalemia because potassium shifts out of cells to accommodate the
influx of hydrogen ion that occurs to compensate for the acidosis. This does not appear to
be a significant issue with organic acidosis or respiratory acid/base imbalances. In general,
dietary potassium intake is matched by urinary output. A smaller amount of potassium is lost
in feces, however colonic secretion can increase if the kidney is not able to excrete adequate
amounts of potassium to maintain homeostasis.

Bicarbonate
Bicarbonate is a major body buffer participating in acid/base homeostasis. It is produced
from water and carbon dioxide by red blood cells, renal tubular cells, and cells in the
stomach lining.


Increased Serum Bicarbonate (alkalosis)
1. Loss of hydrogen ion


2. Gain of bicarbonate


Decreased Serum Bicarbonate (acidosis)
1. Loss or depletion of bicarbonate


2. Increased production of acid


3. Decreased excretion of acid
