Coagulation profile: Prolonged PT and APTT can be explained by markedly impaired liver
function due to low levels of production of coagulation factors. Elevated fibrinogen degradation
products may be seen with liver failure since the liver is responsible for their clearance. The
thrombocytopenia is not expected to occur with uncomplicated poor liver function and in
combination with the other changes suggest disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A
septic process could trigger DIC. Poor baseline liver function could predispose Kabob to DIC
because of the central role of the liver in the regulation of coagulation.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Abdominal ultrasound revealed an enlarged gall bladder with a thickened wall and gall
stones. Kabob was treated with a unit of platelet rich plasma prior to being sent to surgery
on Day 1, where a non-expressible gall bladder and a patent bile duct were observed. A
cholecystectomy for removal of gall stones and liver biopsy were performed. The liver culture
was negative, however the culture of the gall bladder grew alpha _Streptococcus_ and _E. coli._
Examination of biopsy samples revealed suppurative cholecystitis and localized suppurative
hepatitis with diffuse extramedullary hematopoiesis. Ascending bacterial infection of the
biliary tree was considered to be the cause of the liver disease. Kabob was treated with
Actigal [®] (ursodeoxycholic acid), intravenous fluids, and antibiotics.

CBC
Leukogram: On day 3, Kabob has a more marked neutrophilic leukocytosis compared with
day 1, a left shift, monocytosis and toxic changes in the neutrophils. By Day 7 the left shift
and monocytosis are no longer apparent and the neutrophilia is minimal. The severity of the
inflammation appears to be decreasing by Day 7.


Erythrogram: Kabob has a normocytic, normochromic anemia which changes little over the
course of his hospitalization (see above).


Platelets: Platelets are increasing over time in response to therapy.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hypoglycemia: The observation that the hypoglycemia persists as the inflammatory
leukogram resolves is less compatible with sepsis than abnormal liver function as a cause for
the hypoglycemia. Because of persistent hypoglycemia, an ACTH stimulation test was
performed to rule out hypoadrenocorticism, however the results were normal. Some patients
with hypoadrenocorticism can have clinical chemistry abnormalities that mimic decreased
liver function, such as hypoglycemia and hypocholesterolemia (See Kazoo-Case 12).


Low BUN and Creatinine: As suggested above, a combination of overhydration,
polyuria/polydipsia, liver dysfunction, and poor muscle mass could contribute to the low BUN
and creatinine.


Hypocalcemia: This value is increasing towards the reference interval, probably related to the
rising albumin levels.


Minimal hypomagnesemia on day 7: Magnesium transiently increases to the lower limit of
the reference interval on day 3, but is low again on day 7. See discussion above.


Hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia, transient mild hypoglobulinemia: The protein
values may change over time with variation in the hydration status.


Hypokalemia on Day 3 that resolves by Day 7: The potassium status may be improving due
to appropriate supplementation of the intravenous fluids, if the patient begins to eat, or if
ongoing sources of loss are controlled.


Mildly decreased anion gap on Day 7: This mild abnormality is caused by low albumin.


Hyperbilirubinemia, decreasing over time: The inflammatory leukogram and cholestatic
enzyme changes parallel the trend in bilirubin over time, supporting the idea that cholestasis
is the cause of hyperbilirubinemia rather than hemolysis.


Elevated ALP and GGT: The ALP and GGT are appropriately decreasing after surgical
correction of the cause for the cholestasis.


Elevated ALT and AST: As expected, resolution of the cholestatic process and appropriate
medical therapy for any infectious component of the liver disease is leading to a decrease in
the ALT and AST. A rapid fall of greater than 50% in ALT over a few days is often noted to be
a positive prognostic indicator, although scarcity of viable hepatocytes can also be responsible
for this change. Hepatocellular enzyme levels in the blood are nearly normal by Day 7.


Abdominal fluid: Because the fluid analysis is compatible with inflammation, a bacterial
culture is recommended although no organisms were noted on cytology. The absence of bile
pigment and a fluid bilirubin concentration similar to that of the plasma argues for an intact
biliary tree at this time.


Coagulation profile: The coagulopathy appears to be improving along with the resolution of
inflammation and decreasing liver enzymes and bilirubin, further substantiating a diagnosis of
DIC. Impairment of liver function is generally severe by the time prolonged PT and APTT can
be attributed to decreased coagulation factor production by the liver. Improvement in PT
and APTT should not be interpreted as evidence of normal liver function.


Even though no specific tests of liver function were performed, Kabob’s clinical chemistry
profile was very suggestive for decreased liver function along with cholestasis and
hepatocellular damage. She was discharged from the hospital 10 days after surgery with
continuing medical therapy.


Kabob’s blood work should be compared with Yap Yap (Case 7), who had a portosystemic
shunt with decreased liver function. Yap Yap also had hypoglycemia, hypoalbuminemia
(although globulins were normal, making hemorrhage less of a competing differential
diagnosis), and isosthenuria. Yap Yap also had hypocholesterolemia, which is a less consistent
feature of severely impaired liver function than some of the other abnormalities. Concurrent
cholestasis may have upregulated Kabob’s cholesterol production into the normal reference
range. Despite decreased liver function, Yap Yap had a normal bilirubin, while Kabob had
hyperbilirubinemia which could be attributed to several other factors in addition to poor
hepatic function. No coagulation studies were peformed on Yap Yap for comparison. Note
that Nutmeg (Case 16) also had liver disease, however there were no indicators of impaired
liver function on the clinical chemistry profile. This does not guarantee normal liver function,
however liver function is not always abnormal even if there is significant hepatic pathology.

GI Case 22 – Level 3
“Jimbo” is an 8-month-old male Labrador cross who presented because of pronounced
lethargy and depression. The owners report that Jimbo vomited about 5 times over the past
3 days and they discovered several coins in one of the piles of vomitus. Jimbo now has pale,
icteric mucous membranes and his abdomen is painful. Jimbo is febrile, and premature
ventricular complexes are observed on electrocardiogram. He has a history of seizures for
which he currently takes phenobarbital and potassium bromide.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: Jimbo has a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis and monocytosis suggestive for
inflammation. Although the inflammation cannot be precisely localized based on the available
data, the history and clinical chemistry profile indicates the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and
pancreas are potential sites for initial evaluation.


Erythrogram: Jimbo has a marked macrocytic, hypochromic, likely regenerative anemia with
increased numbers of nucleated erythroid precursors released into the circulation as part of
the regenerative response. A reticulocyte count could be performed to quantify the
response. Heinz bodies indicate oxidative damage to erythrocytes as a cause for the
hemolysis. In dogs, exposure to onions (raw or cooked), vitamin K, methylene blue, copper
and zinc are all potential causes of oxidative damage and Heinz body formation.
Spherocytosis is most often associated with immune-mediated damage to erythrocytes,
however some toxicities such as some snake venoms and zinc have been reported to cause
spherocytes as well.


Plasma: The plasma is markedly hemolyzed. This may occur artifactually or with intravascular
hemolysis. Heinz bodies and spherocytes suggest oxidative damage or immune mediated
causes for intravascular hemolysis in this case. The combination of spherocytes and Heinz
bodies is compatible with zinc intoxication. Icteric mucous membranes suggest hyperbilirubinemia, although this cannot be confirmed because serum bilirubin is not available. Some
component of extravascular hemolysis or processing of the heme released in intravascular
hemolysis will elevate serum bilirubin. Elevations in hepatocellular enzymes suggest that


there is the potential for decreased liver function or cholestasis, however cholestatic enzymes
are not available on this panel, nor have specific tests of liver function such as ammonia or
serum bile acids been performed. Because of the affinity of bile pigments for connective
tissue, clinical icterus may persist beyond when hyperbilirubinemia can be documented on
the serum biochemistry profile.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Corticosteroid or epinephrine effects may promote hyperglycemia, however
this degree of hyperglycemia would be unusual for stress alone in the dog. Causes of insulin
resistance that might exacerbate the hyperglycemia such as hyperadrenocorticism could be
considered. While an ALP may be helpful to evaluate this possibility since most dogs with
hyperadrenocorticism have elevated ALP levels, interpretation may be confounded by
increased ALP secondary to bone growth in a young dog or induction from endogenous
corticosteroids in a sick animal. Repeat measurements or long-term indicators of glycemic
control such as fructosamine or glycated hemoglobin may be necessary to determine if this
patient has diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is often associated with hypercholesterolemia
and increased serum triglycerides, which are not noted in this profile.


Increased BUN with normal serum creatinine: A concurrent urinalysis is required for
definitive interpretation of these values and is not available for this case. Nephropathy may
be induced by marked hemoglobinuria in some cases. BUN may also increase prior to
creatinine in early pre-renal azotemia because of the relatively greater influence of tubular
flow rates on the elimination of urea compared to creatinine. When the BUN is elevated but
the serum creatinine is within reference range, extra-renal factors need to be assessed. High
protein diet, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, fever, and tissue necrosis are other extra-renal
causes of increased BUN that should be ruled out in this case.
