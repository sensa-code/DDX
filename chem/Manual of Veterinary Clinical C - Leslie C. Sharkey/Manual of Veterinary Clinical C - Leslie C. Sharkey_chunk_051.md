Case 6 – Level 2
“Picasso” is a 12-year-old intact male Weimeraner presenting for non-painful lumps on his
head that the owners noticed two months ago. On physical examination, Picasso’s teeth are
movable but do not appear painful. Skull radiographs reveal severe bone demineralization in
the maxilla and mandible (Figure 6-2A and B).

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Only limited data are available. There is an anemia that cannot be adequately
characterized as regenerative or non-regenerative without erythrocyte indices or a
microscopic evaluation of anisocytosis and polychromasia and reticulocyte count. A nonregenerative anemia in association with azotemia, isosthenuria, and abnormalities of calcium
and phosphorus is compatible with renal failure. Hypercalcemia of malignancy with secondary
effects on the kidney can result in similar laboratory abnormalities. Anemia of chronic disease
is a common cause of mild, nonregenerative anemia in small animal patients and is likely a
factor in the development of Picasso’s anemia. Alternatively, hematopoietic malignancies
replacing bone marrow can result in a non-regenerative anemia.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Azotemia with isosthenuria: These findings indicate renal azotemia, however if Picasso is
dehydrated, there may be a concurrent pre-renal component. A consideration here is the


ability of hypercalcemia to interfere with urinary concentrating ability. If diagnosed sufficiently
early in the process, the effects of hypercalcemia on the kidney may be reversible; in other
cases, irreversible damage occurs. The BUN, creatinine, and urine specific gravity should be
re-evaluated once the hypercalcemia is corrected to re-assess renal function.


Hypercalcemia with hyperphosphatemia: Hypercalcemia should be associated with
hypophosphatemia due to mass law interactions unless there is another process elevating
phosphorus. Vitamin D toxicity causes elevations in both calcium and phosphorus and should
be ruled out here, although it is less common than the following differential diagnoses.
Azotemia with isosthenuria implicates renal failure as a cause for hyperphosphatemia due to
decreased glomerular filtration rate. Total serum calcium can be high, low, or normal in renal
failure patients, and may not correlate with ionized calcium. In renal failure, hyperphosphatemia inhibits renal 1 -hydroxylase, which decreases production of calcitriol and reduces
α
intestinal calcium absorption and decreases ionized calcium concentration. In response, PTH
secretion is stimulated, which promotes renal excretion of phosphorus and bone demineralization. In many renal failure patients with high total calcium, ionized calcium may be normal
to low. The discrepancy may be due to increased amounts of calcium complexed to anions
such as lactate, sulfate, or phosphate. On the other hand, hypercalcemia associated with
hyperparathyroidism or paraneoplastic hypercalcemia may damage kidneys and precipitate
renal failure. Measurement of ionized calcium, PTH, and PTHrP may help distinguish between
these various pathophysiologic scenarios.


Increased ALP: There are numerous potential causes for increased ALP in dogs, including
enzyme induction by hormones or drugs, metabolic alterations, and liver disease. As an
isolated abnormality, its clinical significance is unclear, particularly if the patient is not taking
any medications that could elevate ALP. Re-evaluation of liver enzymes in 2-4 weeks may reveal
whether the abnormality is persistent and should be investigated further (See Chapter 2).


Urinalysis: The significance of the isosthenuria is discussed above. The urine sediment is
inactive and there is no evidence of inflammation or other lower urinary tract pathology.
Thus, the elevated protein:creatinine ratio can be interpreted as compatible with glomerular
loss of protein.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Further investigation of Picasso’s disease revealed increased ionized calcium of 1.85 mmol/L
(reference interval = 1.25-1.45). Intact PTH was increased while PTHrP was within reference
intervals. The combination of high PTH and increased ionized calcium is compatible with
primary hyperparathyroidism with secondary renal damage. Renal secondary hyperparathyroidism may be associated with either high, low, or normal total calcium, but ionized calcium
is generally low. Because ionized calcium can be high in dogs with renal failure (Schenck),
ultrasound examination of the neck and parathyroid glands was recommended. The owners
did not elect to pursue this option so the diagnosis could not be confirmed.


This case should be compared with Carley (Case 5), in which primary hyperparathyroidism
was confirmed by identification of a parathyroid adenoma. Her case was complicated with
concurrent hepatobiliary disease, however her renal function appeared to be better than
Picasso’s based on the normal BUN, creatinine, and normal to low phosphorus. Like Picasso,
Carley’s urine was not concentrated, probably related to the effects of high ionized calcium
on the renal tubules.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC: Mild lymphopenia could be compatible with stress/corticosteroid effects


Serum Biochemical Profile
Mild increase in BUN with normal creatinine: The elevated BUN could be attributable to a
high protein diet or gastrointestinal bleeding. Mildly decreased renal tubular flow rates,
which increase the time available for renal reabsorption of urea may also increase BUN. Early
pre-renal or renal azotemia may first manifest itself as increased BUN if extra-renal causes of


increased BUN are ruled out. Sepsis is unlikely given the clinical history and relatively normal
leukogram. Hypercalcemia can lead to production of dilute urine, polyuria/polydipsia,
dehydration, or ultimately renal failure in some cases. A urine specific gravity should be
obtained to help interpret the increased BUN. The high normal magnesium and increased
amylase could be compatible with low glomerular filtration rate from renal or pre-renal causes.


Hypercalcemia with normal phosphorus: If the presence of hypercalcemia is verified by
repeat measure, then neoplasia, renal disease, bone lesions or some infectious/inflammatory
diseases should be considered. Primary hyperparathyroidism is much less common than
humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy with increased PTHrP. Measurement of PTH and PTHrP
can help distinguish these processes if a malignancy is difficult to identify clinically. However,
not all neoplasms that cause hypercalcemia produce PTHrP. Renal disease is a possibility here
with elevations in BUN and amylase that could indicate low glomerular filtration rate.
Measurement of ionized calcium could be helpful because hypercalcemia of malignancy is
generally associated with increased ionized calcium. In contrast, most patients with renal
failure have low ionized calcium regardless of total serum calcium values. There are
exceptions, and increased ionized calcium does not rule out renal failure. Distinguishing
between hypercalcemia of malignancy and renal disease is further complicated by the ability
of hypercalcemia of malignancy to cause renal dysfunction (See Jag Chapter 5, case 4). The
combination of hypercalcemia, possible bone pain, and hyperglobulinemia suggests multiple
myeloma, although bone remodeling unrelated to neoplasia may also increase serum calcium.
Radiographic evaluation of the skeleton is indicated. Occasionally, inflammatory diseases such
as blastomycosis and schistosomiasis can cause hypercalcemia, and the presence of these
organisms could stimulate polyclonal hyperglobulinemia associated with an immune response.


Mild hypochloremia: The cause for the mild hypochloremia is not clear in this case. There is
no history of vomiting or any apparent acid/base disorders, however the HCO3 is at the
higher end of the reference interval. Treatment with diuretics can be ruled out by the history.
Further monitoring is recommended to determine if acid/base abnormalities are developing
or if the chloride value normalizes. Because of the way reference ranges are constructed (see
Chapter 1), healthy animals may have results that fall slightly outside of the reference range,
but are normal due to biological variation.


Hyperproteinemia with hyperglobulinemia: Hyperglobulinemia can be due to numerous
causes and can be classified as polyclonal or monoclonal using serum protein electrophoresis.
Polyclonal gammopathies are associated with inflammation/antigenic stimulation with
increased production of acute phase reactant proteins and several types of immunoglobulins.
Monoclonal gammopathies indicate production of a single type of immunoglobulin and are
usually associated with neoplastic proliferation of a single clone of lymphocytes or plasma
cells. Rarely, infectious diseases such as _Leishmania, Ehrlichia,_ or feline infectious peritonitis
can result in monoclonal gammopathy.


Increased amylase: The mild change in this value is most compatible with the decreased
glomerular filtration rate. Gastrointestinal disease can also be associated with increased
amylase and is compatible with the clinical history. Pancreatic disease cannot be ruled out,
but is not required to explain this value. Amylase is a poor indicator of pancreatitis in the cat.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Radiographic evaluation of the lumbar spine revealed lysis of the vertebral body of L4 and
kidneys at the lower limit of normal size. A needle aspirate of the lesion consisted of round
cells containing eccentric nuclei with tightly condensed chromatin and a moderate amount of


basophilic cytoplasm, compatible with plasma cells. A serum protein electrophoresis
documented a monoclonal gammopathy. Cleopatra was diagnosed with multiple myeloma.
She was treated with chemotherapy and responded well, with resolution of her serum
biochemical abnormalities.


Multiple myeloma is rare in dogs, and only scattered reports describing the condition in cats
are available. These suggest that hypercalcemia and osteolytic lesions with accompanying
bone pain may be less common in cats than dogs, but data on cats are sparse (Hickford,
Sheafor, Weber). The hypercalcemia that can accompany multiple myeloma may be caused
by several different mechanisms, including the production of PTHrP, direct osteolysis, or
binding of calcium to myeloma proteins. This will increase the total serum calcium but ionized
calcium should be unaffected. With multiple myeloma, the production of inhibitors of
osteoblast differentiation may help explain why bone lysis is not followed by bone formation
as it is during normal bone remodeling (Glass). Renal disease is frequently a complication of
multiple myeloma in people (Bataille), and has been described in dogs and cats. Renal
insufficiency may be related to concurrent hypercalcemia, neoplastic infiltration of the kidney,
protein precipitation in the kidney, or amyloidosis or glomerulonephritis (Sheafor). As noted
above, renal disease can cause an increase in total serum calcium and contribute to the
hypercalcemia seen with malignancy.

Case 8 – Level 2
“General” is a 1-day-old male Thoroughbred foal. The owners report that the birth was
“difficult”. His dam was colicky before and after delivery. She died several hours after
delivery despite medical therapy for colic. The foal appeared to nurse well after birth despite
the poor condition of the mother, and the owners feel that he likely got adequate colostrum.
On presentation, the foal is bright, alert, and responsive, but appears weak in the hindlimbs
and occasionally drags the right hind limb. All joints appear to be of normal size with no
excessive heat, swelling, or pain on palpation. He passed feces, but appears mildly colicky.
