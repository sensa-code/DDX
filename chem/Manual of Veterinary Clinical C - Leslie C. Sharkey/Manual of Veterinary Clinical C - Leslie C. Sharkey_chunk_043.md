Hypercholesterolemia: Increases in cholesterol have been described in dogs with glomerular
nephritis and dogs with nephrotic syndrome. The mechanism for hypercholesterolemia in
nephrotic syndrome may be increased hepatic synthesis, and these patients often have an
inverse relationship between albumin and cholesterol (which is not present in this patient).
Abnormal lipoprotein lipase function related to inadequate amounts of its co-factor, heparan
sulfate, may also contribute to the hypercholesterolemia in nephrotic syndrome.


Increased Creatine kinase: This is evidence for muscle degeneration or necrosis. Muscle
breakdown associated with anorexia in cats can elevate serum CK (Fascetti). CK levels
normalized in anorexic cats once they were given adequate nutritional support.


Urinalysis: Proteinuria of 2+ in dilute urine with an inactive sediment is compatible with
glomerular loss of protein. There is no evidence of blood contamination or lower urinary tract
disease in this case to account for the protein in the urine. A urine protein:creatinine ratio is
recommended to further evaluate urinary protein losses. It is worthwhile noting that significant
glomerular protein loss is not always associated with hypoalbuminemia because of the
capacity of a healthy liver for compensatory upregulate of albumin production. Dehydration
can also mask hypoproteinemia in some cases.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Ziggy was treated with aggressive fluid therapy and potassium supplementation. As his
dehydration was corrected, the pre-renal component of his azotemia was eliminated and his
other laboratory abnormalities improved but did not normalize. Ziggy was discharged from
the hospital with treatment plan including subcutaneous fluids, oral potassium supplementation, and gastroprotectants. His long term prognosis is guarded because the combination
of his laboratory work and small kidneys are compatible with chronic renal failure, which is
not reversible. This case should be compared with Marklar (Case 1), Jag (Case 4), and
Popcorn (Case 24, in this chapter), in which appropriate treatment resulted in complete
normalization of laboratory data and restoration of urinary concentrating ability. Note that
the degree of azotemia was not predictive of prognosis in these cases, nor did it allow differentiation of renal, pre-renal, or post-renal causes of azotemia.


This case is very similar to Tramp (Chapter 5, Case 10), but Tramp has more severe azotemia
and anemia. Tramp’s creatinine value is higher than Ziggy’s, however this is not conclusive
proof that Tramp has worse renal function than Ziggy. First of all, the pre-renal component
may be different between the two patients. Second, while serial measurements of BUN and
creatinine can be used to monitor renal function in individual patients, the use of BUN and
creatinine to compare renal function between patients is questionable because of large
interindividual variations in BUN and creatinine values (Braun). The non-specific nature of the
Jaffé reaction used to measure creatinine in most veterinary chemistry analyzers leads to
variation in creatinine values unrelated to changes in glomerular filtration rate, but this is
more likely to cause discrepancies at low creatinine concentrations. In addition, it should be
remembered that the relationship between plasma creatinine and glomerular filtration rate is
curvilinear. Thus, small changes in the low end of the creatinine range can correspond to
large changes in glomerular filtration rate, while at higher creatinine concentrations, relatively
large changes in creatinine can be associated with smaller decrements in glomerular filtration
rate. Comparison of the two cases illustrates the variable electrolyte findings in chronic renal
failure cases. In neither case was the cause for the renal failure determined.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: There is a mild mature neutrophilia and lymphopenia, most compatible with
corticosteroid effects. The neutrophilia could also be compatible with inflammation, however
the normal fibrinogen makes this interpretation less likely because fibrinogen is an acute
phase reactant that should increase early in the inflammatory response of horses.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Elevations in serum glucose in the horse are most often caused increases in
endogenous catecholamines and glucocorticoids secondary to excitement or stress,
respectively. A corticosteroid effect is supported by the concurrent lymphopenia.


Azotemia: With no urine specific gravity to aid interpretation, it is difficult to classify the
azotemia. The clinical history, the electrolyte abnormalities, and the high creatinine
concentration of the abdominal fluid are compatible with uroabdomen, a cause of post-renal
azotemia. Pre-renal factors may also contribute to the azotemia. Accumulation of fluid in the
abdomen may cause intravascular volume contraction and lower the glomerular filtration
rate. Dehydration because of poor nursing also adds to the pre-renal azotemia.


Hyperphosphatemia: The most likely cause for the hyperphosphatemia in this case is
decreased glomerular filtration rate. Serum phosphorus can also be high during skeletal
growth and development in young animals.


Hyponatremia and hypochloremia: Because of the abdominal effusion, third space loss of
sodium and chloride are likely. In the case of uroabdomen, sodium and chloride diffuse down
their concentration gradients into the fluid accumulating in the abdomen. The resulting
contraction of the intravascular fluid volume leads to stimulation of the renin-angiotensin
system, which will tend to conserve sodium and water. In addition, antidiuretic hormone will
stimulate free water retention and thirst, which will have a dilutional effect on the remaining
electrolytes in the circulation.


Hyperkalemia: When the body cannot eliminate urine, potassium will be retained. This may
occur with post-renal azotemia or in the anuric/oliguric phase of renal failure. This is in
contrast to the polyuric phase of renal failure, in which increased tubular flow rates promote
potassium wasting, resulting from decreased time for reabsorption. As has been noted for
other cases with electrolyte changes of hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and hyperkalemia,
hypoadrenocorticism is a differential diagnosis, however this is very unlikely in this patient
because of signalment and history.


Hyperbiliruinemia: The most likely cause for the hyperbilirubinemia in this patient is
anorexia, Fasted horses typically have increased indirect bilirubin with normal to mildly
elevated direct bilirubin. In horses with cholestasis, the reverse pattern of a high direct


bilirubin with normal to mildly increased indirect value is usually seen. Mechanisms suggested
for fasting-induced hyperbilirubinemia include either increased mobilization of free fatty acids
that interfere with bilirubin uptake by hepatocytes, or inadequate availability of glucose for
conjugation with bilirubin. Hemolysis is another possible contributor to the hyperbilirubinemia. In this case, the PCV is within the reference range, however some degree of
hemolysis cannot be ruled out. In horses, causes of hemolytic anemias include neonatal
isoerythrolysis, drug effects, infectious agents (Babesia, Leptospirosis, Equine Infectious
Anemia virus), metabolic derangements, or plant intoxication. Microscopic evaluation of
erythrocytes did not reveal any morphologic abnormalities such as Heinz bodies,
eccentrocytes, or parasites that would suggest that any of the above are likely.


Increased ALP and GGT: While hepatobiliary disease cannot be completely ruled out, these
elevations in ALP and GGT are likely to be normal age-related changes. In a young horse, an
increased ALP reflects bone growth. GGT activity is normally higher in foals less than one
month of age, and can be one and a half to three times the value of adult horses (Patterson).
Donkeys and burros may also have higher values. There is no increase in the AST to support
hepatic pathology, although an SDH was not measured.


Abdominal fluid analysis: The fluid is a low protein effusion with a creatinine concentration
that greatly exceeds the serum creatinine, compatible with the presence of urine in the
abdomen. Because of its small size, urea diffuses out of the effusion and is not helpful in the
diagnosis of uroabdomen. The slightly increased cell counts and predominance of
nondegenerate neutrophils is compatible with a mild chemical peritonitis.

###### **Case Summary and Outcome**

Appropriate fluid therapy was initiated, and abdominal radiographs with a contrast study of
the bladder indicated bladder rupture. Therapeutic abdominocentesis and therapy to reduce
serum potassium were performed to prepare Sloop for surgery, where a four centimeter tear
was repaired on the dorsal aspect of her urinary bladder. Recovery was uneventful, and Sloop
was able to stand and nurse one hour after surgery. Sloop began to improve steadily and gain
weight. She was discharged several days after surgery to complete her recovery at home.


As noted for many of the cases, Sloop’s azotemia does not distinguish pre-renal, renal, or
post-renal processes. The electrolyte abnormalities can be slightly more helpful, in that
hyperkalemia is most often present with urinary outflow obstruction (see Ringo, Case 7) or in
the oliguric/anuric phase of chronic renal failure (see Margarite, Case 9).

Case 19 – Level 3
“Faith” is a 9-year-old miniature mare presenting with a history of developing laminitis 10 days
ago, for which she was treated with a course of oral phenylbutazone. She was referred for
signs of colic, and at presentation, she was depressed. On physical examination, Faith had a
marked tachycardia, increased respiratory rate with normal lung sounds, and a mild fever. Her
mucous membranes were injected and she had an ulcer on her buccal mucosal surface. She
has 8/9 body condition score. Nasogastric intubation did not produce reflux. Rectal palpation
was not possible due to her small size.

###### **Interpretation**

CBC
Leukogram: Faith has a neutrophilic leukocytosis with a regenerative left shift and mild toxic
change, all of which support inflammation. The hyperfibrinogenemia corroborates this
interpretation.


Erythrogram: Her PCV is at the lower end of the reference interval. Correction of any
dehydration may result in mild anemia.


Serum Biochemical Profile
Hyperglycemia: Elevations in serum glucose in the horse are most often caused by
endogenous catecholamines and glucocorticoids release secondary to excitement or stress.
Leukogram findings are not specific for either of these effects. Diabetes mellitus is rare in
domestic large animal species. Hyperadrenocorticism in the horse may predispose to
development of hyperglycemia, related to insulin resistance.


Azotemia and Urinalysis: Azotemia in conjunction with concentrated urine indicates prerenal azotemia. Dehydration secondary to colic will contribute to pre-renal azotemia. Poor
tissue perfusion secondary to systemic vasodilation with sepsis can also be a factor. While the
urine specific gravity at this time supports pre-renal azotemia, the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatories at high doses or in combination with other nephrotoxic drugs or dehydration
can cause kidney damage and needs to be monitored (see Joe, Chapter 5, Case 11, and
Calvin, Chapter 2, Case 20).
